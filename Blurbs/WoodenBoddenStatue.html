<p>
	This small, svelte statuette depicts a thin, muscular-looking <a href="../Blurbs/Bodden.html">Bodden</a>. Obviously hand-carved by someone with great skill, its weight and solidness gives you the impression that this is a real treasure. It's made from klinwood and polished or lacquered in some way that its surface is both very hard and somewhat shiney (almost glowing). This statue would be a welcome addition to any God's Temple Treasure Room. You can carry 1.
