<p>
	Yes, these are those slow-moving guys with outstretched arms, wrapped in gray moldy bandages.
	They resemble the ones you last saw in an Abbot & Costello Meet the Mummy movie.
	They're the guardians of <a href="../Locations/AncientGraveyard.html">Graveyards</a> and <a href="../Locations/TombOfMumi.html">Tombs</a>.
	Battling them is a difficult task, as <a href="../Items/Bashing.html">Bashing</a> weapons don't seem very effective.
	When their decaying flesh is exposed to the outside air, they scream with pain which makes you wonder how alive the undead actually are.
