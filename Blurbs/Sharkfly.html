<p>
	If you're just plodding along in <a href="../Items/Swamp.html">swampy</a> or <a href="../Items/Sticks.html">Sticks</a> terrain and find yourself ferociously attacked by a small bird, an opportunistic Sharkfly has found you.
	It wants you for dinner. It has a very small brain and doesn't doesn't realise that you're more than it can handle.
	So what if it is the smallest bird on the Island - that its advantage. Trying to hit it is like trying to swat mosquitoes with a 2x4.
	Naturally, it comes complete with an amazing set of chompers. Yowzer!
