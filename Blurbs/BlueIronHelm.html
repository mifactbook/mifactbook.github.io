<p>
	A fine choice in armor wear if ever there was one. This iron <a href="../Items/Helmets.html">helm</a> is coated in a deep blue color that matches the sky just before sunset. In addition to its color, this helm provides <a href="../Items/Three.html">armor class 3</a> protection for your head while in battle. You can carry as many as two.
