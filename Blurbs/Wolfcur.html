<p>
	The good news is that this is the least dangerous wolf of the island. The bad news is that its awesome jaws and knife-like teeth can rip you to shreds.
	Bashing its brains out is your only hope. It is most often found in Low Hills terrain and some- times has a companion nearby.
	The Wolfcur is obviously a descendant of a deranged(?) wolf-bear breeding experiment.
	Special note: This Creature is a minion of the <a href="../Items/Shroud.html">Dark</a>.
