<p>
	To a Troll, a Brass Amulet is a thing of extraordinary beauty. To the rest of the monster races, it is an ugly blob of poorly sculpted junk that is neither pretty nor valuable. Still, you can get a few <a href="../Blurbs/Ocular.html">Oculars</a> for them in trade. You can carry up to ten of these.
