	Junk is well junk. Mostly useless items that one normally ignores as trash or refuse. Annoying items that hardly count as treasure. Occasionally, instead of leaving the junk where you found it a particular piece of junk just speaks to you and you decide to pick it up. The monster brain is sure there is something useful about this particular piece of trash. The thought of leaving it in someone else's pack is entertaining. Depending on the junk, you can carry a lot. Why else do Monsters have so many pockets?
