	<p>Definately not killing machines like the Deadly Mutates, but not the cream-puffs of the <a href="../Blurbs/LesserMutates.html">Lesser Mutates</a>, Mutates represent some of the more hideous and dangerous examples of monster science gone awry. They consist of some of the deadlier parts of some of the more deadly creatures you might find running loose on Monster Island. From the evil <a href="../Blurbs/Octopaw.html">Octopaw</a> to the horrible <a href="../Blurbs/Cheezer.html">Cheezer</a>, these guys are trouble. They are as evil a brew of horrors as anyone would ever want to face. Keep a good weapon handy when you enter certain dark places and you may survive...then again, you may end up adding to a large pile of bones near some Mutates den.</p>
