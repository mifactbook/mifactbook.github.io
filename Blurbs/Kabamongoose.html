<p>
	The Kabamongoose is one of the swiftest creatures of the island. Zip, zip.
	When this good-sized Creature isn't busy hunt- ing snakes, it hunts bigger prey. It's sort of fearless. And stupid.
	Render it senseless (or worse) with an <a href="../Items/Edged.html">Edged</a> weapon.
	The Kabamongoose is off-white in color, with some gray speckles, and is most often found in bamboo-laden terrain.
