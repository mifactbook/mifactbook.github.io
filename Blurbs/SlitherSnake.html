<p>
	Though very thin, a Slither Snake is 6-8 hands long and loves to bite, bite, and then bite s'more.
	Good thing its venom is only irritating (it leaves a rash) and not poisonous.
	The Slither Snake is often found in wet terrain and also slithering about in bamboo-rich terrain. It makes a "swish" sound shortly before striking.
