blurb: 'Disguised as rocks in <a href="../Items/Swamp.html">Swamp</a> terrain, these mushrooms are feared by Monsters everywhere. Okay, not exactly feared. It''s just that you can''t help jumping when you step on what looks like a firm rock and nearly twist your ankle while an ugly squishing noise fills your ears.'
