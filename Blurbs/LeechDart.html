<p>
	Kill an <a href="../Blurbs/EightFangedLeech.html">Eight-Fanged Leech</a> and you get the pleasure of harvesting a handful of Leech Darts from its mouth. They make an adequate <a href="../Items/Missile.html">missile</a> weapon when combined with a <a href="../Blurbs/BlowPipe.html">Blow Pipe</a>. They do <a href="../Items/Three.html">Class 3</a> damage and you can carry as many as 16.
