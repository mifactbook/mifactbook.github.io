<p>
	Scurrying sideways across a sand dune is a Mandibular Crab. This brown crustacean stands nearly 6 hands tall on six spindly legs.
	Its jaws protrude several hands forward and it can snap a good-sized branch in two. A funny claw-like appendage grows from the center of its back.
	Although this claw appears deadly at first glance, it's actually used by the crab to burrow into the soft sand rather than for battle.
	A <a href="../Items/Pointed.html">Pointed</a> weapon would probably do the most damage against it, provided you're strong enough to penetrate its exoskeletal protection.
