<p>
	In the distance you hear a deep rumble.
	Soon, the ground begins to shake as if a herd of <a href="../Blurbs/Tusker.html">Tuskers</a> are on the rampage.
	A cloud of dust rises and moves in your direction. If this ever happens to you, take cover because you are about to meet the incredible Rumble Beast.
	Ironically, it is nowhere near as big as a Tusker, or even a <a href="../Blurbs/Plodder.html">Plodder</a> for that matter.
	What is unique is the beast's feet. They are huge. Something like size XXXXXXXXXXL. Each step rattles the very earth and leaves massive footprints.
	One mistep from this beast and you will be little more than tow jam.
