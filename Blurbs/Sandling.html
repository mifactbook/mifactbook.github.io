<p>
	A wicked little creature of <a href="../Items/SandPalms.html">Sand and Palms</a> is the Sandling.
	This serpent-like beast lies just below the surface in a loose pile of sand waiting for prey to walk across its hiding place.
	Once detected, it springs from its hiding place to slash and bite with sharp teeth and long claws.
	It then drags the carcass beneath the sands to munch and crunch.
