<p>
	Ingots can only be found in the deepest <a href="../Blurbs/ZoingoMutant.html">Zoingot</a> <a href="../Locations/MineShaft.html">Mines</a>. These pitch-black pieces of ore are laboriously pulled from the earth and fashioned into perfect cubes by Mine Trolls. They are small and may be the Island's hardest ore. You can carry ten.
