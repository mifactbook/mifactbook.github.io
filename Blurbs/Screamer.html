	Considered by Kwandonians to be THE most annoying insect ever created, Screamers are nasty little creatures who make a horrific clatter with their shrill voices.
	Combined with their rattly wings, they can generate an enormous headache in just minutes.
	Even worse of all, if you let their racket get to you, they will attack and chew you to little pieces.
