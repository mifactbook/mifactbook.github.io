title: Vipers
blurb: |
  <p>They are the toughest, the darkest, and the lowliest. Yes Vipers are the lowest form of scum around.
  That's why they're the most likely to dabble in <a href="../Blurbs/Voodoo.html">voodoo</a> (and that can lead to unimaginable dangers!). Vipers
  particularly love the <a href="../Items/Jungle.html">Jungle</a> and fight quite well there. They have excellent aim and are pretty good climbers.
  Vipers love to attack whatever moves. Not surprisingly, Vipers have the most difficult time making friends with  members of the other Seven Monster Races.</p>
