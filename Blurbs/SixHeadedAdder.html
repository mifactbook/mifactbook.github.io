<p>
	This snake has so many heads that fighting it just isn't fun. So you lop off a head or two; it still has plenty remaining to finish you off.
	Depressing. A great <a href="../Items/Edged.html">Edged</a> weapon could make the difference between dinner for you and dinner for him.
	If you're a wimp, avoid <a href="../Items/Jungle.html">Jungle</a> and <a href="../Items/Swamp.html">Swamp</a> terrain and you'll be safe.
	Unless, that is, you wander into the wrong cave.
