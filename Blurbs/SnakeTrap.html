	One of the nicer things about <a href="../Items/Jungle.html">Jungle</a> terrain is that you can always find spaggle sheet moss and blitter vines. With your <a href="../Blurbs/Knife.html">Knife</a>, you can spend 8 Action Points to make a Snake Trap in any Jungle square. Write the MAKE order: M 103. Once you have a Snake Trap, and your Capture Creature is set to a snake (not a huge one, though), and you come upon this snake, it is quite likely that you'll catch the snake. Once you've caught a snake, trapping a pit will place the snake down in it - and, well, we'll leave the rest to your imagination. You can carry two Snake Traps (one is a spare).
