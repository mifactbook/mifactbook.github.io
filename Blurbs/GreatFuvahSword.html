<p>
	Here's a sword that'll make blood flow from <a href="../Items/Fuvah.html">Fuvah</a>'s enemies! This deadly-looking great sword is light, sharp, and has a nice, solid grip. To equip it requires a minimum of 255 Muscle and rank of Fuvite <a href="../Items/Fuvah.html">Disciple</a> (It jumps out of the hands of anyone else). The sword is a <a href="../Items/Five.html">Class 5</a> <a href="../Items/Edged.html">Edged</a> weapon, but when wielded against Monsters and Creatures who follow or are favoured by other gods, its damage is significantly greater. You can carry 1.
