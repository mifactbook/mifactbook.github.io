<p>
	Doing its best to look like a boulder off a large <a href="../Items/CrystalHills.html">crystal hill</a>, the Crystal Crab is nearly diamond hard and has the pleasant demeanor of a <a href="../Blurbs/Centripod.html">Centripod</a> with fungal feet.
	If you meet one, watch out for its bashing claw, otherwise you'll get one crystal headache.
