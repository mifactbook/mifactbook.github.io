<p>
	This is a remarkable invention which should mean that you never get lost again. To make one, attach a <a href="../Blurbs/BowString.html">Bow String</a> to a <a href="../Blurbs/BlackBall.html">Black Ball</a> using a portion of <a href="../Blurbs/WaxedOoze.html">Waxed Ooze</a> by issuing the MAKE order: M 250. It takes 25 Action Points to perform this delicate operation. When dangled by the string, the ball exhibits a very slight but noticeable movement from the vertical and more importantly, always towards the east, as if drawn there by some mystical force. You may carry 2 (1 spare as they're quite a fragile device) and will use it went the need arises.
