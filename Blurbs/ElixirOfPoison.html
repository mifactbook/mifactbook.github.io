<p>
	A devilishly clever little potion, Elixir of Poison makes use of some of the arcane Black <a href="../Blurbs/Voodoo.html">Voodoo</a> and equally arcane <a href="../Blurbs/ZoingoMutant.html">Zoingot</a> <a href="../Blurbs/Wizard.html">Wizardry</a> to make a nasty little <a href="../Items/Missile.html">missile</a> weapon. To make one combine one <a href="../Blurbs/BlackCaveSpore.html">Black Cave Spore</a> with one <a href="../Blurbs/GuanoPlasm.html">Guano Plasm</a> and cook them along with one <a href="../Blurbs/Oil.html">Oil</a> for 18 Action Points in your <a href="../Items/Vessels.html">Voodoo Cauldron</a>. Equip it like any other missile weapon. Just be sure to step back when your opponent starts to spew! You can carry six.
