<p>
	Every Monster likes something covering his head, offering some protection from an occasional enemy club. A Squzskin <a href="../Items/Helmets.html">Helmet</a> fits the bill, making one helluva fashion statement to boot!
	Just collect two <a href="../Blurbs/Squzskin.html">Squzskins</a> and using your <a href="../Blurbs/Knife.html">Knife</a>, work it for 30 Action Points using the MAKE order: M 49. This Helmet provides <a href="../Items/One.html">Armor Class 1</a> protection
	and you may carry two of them.
