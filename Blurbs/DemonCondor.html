<p>
	Swoop de doop. This is one dangerous bird of prey. The Demon Condor has huge, massive wings, making it both very powerful and difficult to escape.
	This is the first bird you've seen that seems to have a very devilish look on its face.
	Its talons aren't razor sharp, but unless you kill it right away, you're going to be in for the ride of your life! Hope you've got a <a href="../Blurbs/Parachute.html">parachute</a>!
