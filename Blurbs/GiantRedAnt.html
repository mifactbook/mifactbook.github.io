<p>
	The Giant Red Ant is very similar in appearance to the smaller Giant Black Ant.
	The biggest difference besides colouring, is the terrible burning senstation that accompanies it's bite.
	At 5 hands in length, this is not a creature you really want to mess with.
	A <a href="../Items/Pole.html">Pole</a> Class weapon may have a chance to penetrate the joints in its body and will provide some chance to keep it off you.
