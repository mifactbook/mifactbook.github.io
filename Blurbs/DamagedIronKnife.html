<p>
	This <a href="../Blurbs/Knife.html">Knife</a> is nice and heavy. Too bad it's severely nicked and dinged in places. Still, it is a <a href="../Items/One.html">Damage Class 1</a> <a href="../Items/Pointed.html">Pointed</a> Weapon in its current state. Have it repaired by a <a href="../Locations/FarForge.html">Forger</a> to return it to its original <a href="../Items/Two.html">Damage Class - 2</a>. You can carry two.
