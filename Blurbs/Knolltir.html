blurb: |
  <p>When you think of puny Monsters you think of the Knolltir. When you think of weasly, scummy, and not terribly bright Monsters, you think of the Knolltir. Picture a thin Orcish type, equipped with a <a href="../Blurbs/JaggedBodkin.html">Jagged Bodkin</a>,
  spear or club. And sometimes a <a href="../Blurbs/Sling.html">Sling</a>. All but the most inexperienced of the Seven Monster Races simply grind Knolltors into hamburgers. However, there's a saying that where there's one Knolltir there's a dozen more.
  And that can be a problem. Battle is very tiring to anyone...and once fatigue sets in, the next Knolltir may get lucky. They live in bands, usually in hilly areas. They wear <a href="../Blurbs/LeatherArmour.html">Leather Armor</a> and often sport
  a <a href="../Blurbs/SquzskinHelmet.html">Squzskin Helm</a>. Their voices are high-pitched but not very loud.</p>
