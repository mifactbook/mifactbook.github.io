title: Boddens
blurb: |
  <p>The clannish Boddens are the denizens of <a href="../Items/HighJungle.html">High Jungle</a> terrain. They're quite tall and very bony-looking. Friendly they're not, and they're quick to demonstrate their accuracy with <a href="../Blurbs/Blowpipe.html">Blowpipe</a> darts.
  Boddens also have a flair with <a href="../Items/Whip.html">Whip</a> weaponry. They dress in a leafy covering that doesn't look like it provides any useful protection. If you find that you can't get to a certain square in High Jungle terrain (no vines going into it),
  you've located a square in which one of the Bodden Clans live. Which is not necessarily a good thing.</p>
