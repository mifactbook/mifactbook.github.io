<p>
	You have 30 Action Points and three <a href="../Blurbs/DactylHide.html">Dactyl Hides</a>? Great! Use the MAKE order: M 8, and you'll have yourself a Dactyl Whip. It's a <a href="../Items/Whip.html">Whip</a> weapon of <a href="../Items/Three.html">Damage Class 3</a>. The Dactyl Whip is particularly useful against thin-skinned Creatures. You can carry only one Dactyl Whip and you do need a <a href="../Blurbs/Knife.html">Knife</a> to make it.
