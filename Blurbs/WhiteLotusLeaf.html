<p>
	This large, pure white leaf is rare and can be found in areas littered with bamboo shoots. This leaf has a crisp, refreshing odor. The scent implies that it must be useful and is worth keeping. The leaf of the White Lotus shrub is green with white spots. Some of its leaves change to all- white (periodically) and these are the ones you'll pick. There's no limit to the number of leaves you can carry.
