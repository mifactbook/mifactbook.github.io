<p>
	Minding your own business, walking through <a href="../Items/LowHills.html">hilly</a> terrain, you are suddenly alerted to a rumbling sound that gets louder and louder.
	Then 'KAWHAM!' you are knocked off your feet by a falling rock. But that is no rock, it's a Rollypod.
	A curious little beast that has the ability to ball itself up and use its form as a weapon, making it a challenging beast to kill.
