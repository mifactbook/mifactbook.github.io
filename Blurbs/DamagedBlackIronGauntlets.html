<p>
	These Damaged Black Iron <a href="../Items/Gauntlets.html">Gauntlets</a> have seen more than their share of wear but they still seem to hold up fairly well. Their flat black color gives them an ominous feel and you wonder if you could even see them at night. In the best of condition, these make great armor. As is, they provide <a href="../Items/Two.html">Armor Class 2</a> protection and you can carry one one pair.
