title: Kwando
blurb: |
  <p>The Kwando are probably the most intelligent race you've met. If they could get their marketing up to the level of the <a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html">Jossmen</a>, they'd have it made.
  Natural inventors, they've come up with the <a href="../Blurbs/LockedLargeBox.html">Large Box</a>, the <a href="../Blurbs/BlackBall.html">Black Ball</a>, and now the <a href="../Blurbs/FireStone.html">Firestone</a> Balloon;
  the only known way to cross the <a href="../Items/CrystalHills.html">Crystal Hills</a>. Using a <a href="../Blurbs/SwingingBall.html">Swinging Ball</a> to navigate, a Kwando Aviator somehow manages to guide a balloon to pick-up points in Starth.
  They must have pretty good hearing as well to hear you yelling for them. The charge for the service is in Oculars, but they prefer to be paid in <a href="../Blurbs/KwandoGuilderCoin.html">Kwando Guilder Coins</a>,
  valuing them at 10 Oculars each. One strange idea they have is domesticating <a href="../Blurbs/Loggerhead.html">Loggerheads</a> as bodyguards. All other civilised races simply put Loggerheads out of their misery.</p>
