<p>
	It's said this <a href="../Items/Swamp.html">Swamp</a> Creature is born foaming at the mouth and the condition only worsens with age.
	The resulting slobbering noise makes it fairly easy to spot. The weasle-like body is encrusted with open sores oozing a sticky lime-green pus.
	A <a href="../Items/Pointed.html">Pointed</a> weapon seems to work best - but be sure to wipe it off afterwards.
