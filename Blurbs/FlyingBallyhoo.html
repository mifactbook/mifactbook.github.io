<p>
	Twelve hands long and full of piscine attitude, the Flying Ballyhoo is the toughest, orneriest fish a Ruk could ever hope to meet.
	Equipped with a pike-like bill and "scale"-mail armour, this beast is tough to meet in the water.
	To compound things, its long pectoral fins allow it to fly free of the water and their razor-sharp edges can cut you to ribbons.
	When it is through slicing and dicing, it will glide back to the water and slurp up the big pieces.
