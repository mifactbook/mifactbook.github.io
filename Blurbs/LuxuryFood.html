	Luxury food covers a wide range of ready-to-eat meals especially prepared for the discerning <a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html">Jossman</a> palate. Such culinary masterpieces include <a href="../Blurbs/Landshark.html">Landshark</a> Roe, Roast Bush Quail, <a href="../Blurbs/FlamingGourd.html">Flaming Gourd</a> Pie and the <i>piece de resistance</i>, Scarlet Grackle Surprise. They are nothing like the meals you get at an <a href="../Locations/FarInn.html">inn</a> (in fact you're pretty sure you couldn't stomach they way they've been cooked). They're obviously only eaten in private or on special occasions. A shrewd traveller could probably make a profit on his journeys by transporting luxury food to where it's most in demand. You may carry up to 8 of these delicacies. N.B. Even if you're ravenously hungry, you will not risk the gut-rot you'd be sure to get from such a rich food.
