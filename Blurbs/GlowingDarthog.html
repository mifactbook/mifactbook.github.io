<p>
	The Glowing Darthog is a creature of the day by necessity. It's not the biggest creature around but it is unique.
	It gives off an unearthly green glow bright enough to light up a room.
	This, of course, makes it an easy target for the nocturnal predators of Monster Island.
	For you, a day time Ruk, it just means its a curiosity that can bite your head off.
