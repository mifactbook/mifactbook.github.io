<p>
	This cocoa-colored body armor is easy to make. You need 2 <a href="../Blurbs/BarkbruteSkin.html">Barkbrute Skins</a> and a <a href="../Blurbs/Knife.html">Knife</a>. You need to be in <a href="../Items/Jungle.html">Jungle</a> terrain (so that you can find things to tie and bind it). Issue the MAKE order: M 107. It takes 18 Action Points. Barkbrute Armor provides <a href="../Items/Three.html">Armor Class 3</a> protection. You can carry one suit.
