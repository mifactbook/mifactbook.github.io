<p>
	Winged reptilian denizen of the most aweful bat infested caves, the Ng'echo either lives in huge batlizard colonies or it's got one of the most awesome voices this side of Harry Maninose and his level 7 vocal chords.
	If you run across this beastie, just recognise that you'll come away with your ears and your head aching that is if you walk away at all!
