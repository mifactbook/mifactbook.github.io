<p>
	Sounds like great stuff, huh? Take an <a href="../Blurbs/Oozelet.html">Oozelet</a> and squish it between two <a href="../Blurbs/MudgeWax.html">Mudge Wax</a>. This takes two Action Points. Issue the MAKE order: M 105. What do you do with it? Your brain has yet to figure that out. You can carry 4.
