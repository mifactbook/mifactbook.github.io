<p>
	This is the silver equivalent to the <a href="../Blurbs/Knolltir.html">Knolltir</a>'s <a href="../Blurbs/JaggedBodkin.html">Jagged Bodkin</a>. It is a <a href="../Items/Pointed.html">Pointed</a> Weapon of <a href="../Items/Two.html">Damage Class 2</a>. Because it's crafted with silver, it is particularly effective against foes who are vulnerable to silver weaponry. You can carry a pair of 'em.
