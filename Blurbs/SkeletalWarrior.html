<p>
	Not the hackneyed pile of bones of a <a href="../Blurbs/Skeleton.html">Skeleton</a>, the skeletal Warrior was created by a novice Mage from the bleached bones of a dead warrior.
	They are usually equipped with remnant <a href="../Blurbs/BlackIronGauntlets.html">Black Iron Gauntlets</a> which they wore in a previous life.
	This makes them a little tougher to bash to pieces and, if you look closely into their eye sockets, you might even see a hint of intelligence.
	This makes for a scarey foe.
