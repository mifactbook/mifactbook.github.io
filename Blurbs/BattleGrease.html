<p>
	Devilishly clever. Designed to be an inocuous <a href="../Items/Missile.html">missile</a> weapon doing little damage, Battle Grease is just that - a greasy, oily mixture that, when hurled at your opponent will cause their primary weapon to be slick and difficult to wield. Best yet, it is extraordinarily easy to make. Just issue the MAKE order: M 257 and if you have one <a href="../Blurbs/Oil.html">oil</a> and one <a href="../Blurbs/SwineFat.html">Swine Fat</a> to mix in your <a href="../Blurbs/VoodooCauldron.html">voodoo cauldron</a>, you'll whip up a batch. It'll take 15 Action Points to make and you equip it to use it in battle.
