<p>
	You're in <a href="../Items/Sticks.html">Sticks</a> terrain and you hear an Oink? OINK! Stay out of the path of this marauding swine.
	Protruding from its fat head are fifteen horn-like, hand-long spikes. And it likes to see just how many times they can impact on a foe's face.
	How nice. Stab this red brick-colored bandit with a <a href="../Items/Pointed.html">Pointed</a> weapon.
