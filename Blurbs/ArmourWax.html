<p>
	Turtle Shell is an age-old way of making weak armor strong and making strong armor even stronger. To make an application, just cook up 2 <a href="../Blurbs/WaxedOoze.html">Waxed Ooze</a>, 30 <a href="../Blurbs/BallyhooScale.html">Ballyhoo Scales</a>, and 2 <a href="../Blurbs/Oil.html">Oil</a> in a <a href="../Blurbs/VoodooCauldron.html">Voodoo Cauldron</a>. By cooking it for 21 AP, the Ballyhoo Scales will dissolve into the waxed Ooze. Use the M 464 Order to make one. To use it, issue the U 464 Order. You will apply one application to your skin and armor and get much better protection in battle If an opponent is strong enough, you will need to re-apply after battle You can carry up to 20 of these.
