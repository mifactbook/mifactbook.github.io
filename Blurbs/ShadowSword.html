<p>
	This dark-coloured, well balanced <a href="../Items/Fuvah.html">Fuvite</a> <a href="../Blurbs/LongSword.html">Long Sword</a> is difficult to see, enabling it to hit home with great damage. Normally it is a <a href="../Items/Four.html">Damage Class 4</a> <a href="../Items/Edged.html">Edged</a> weapon, but when wielded against Monsters and creatures who are favoured by a god other than Fuvah, its damage is doubled. It can only be equipped by a Fuvite whose Muscle is at least 110. You can carry 1.
