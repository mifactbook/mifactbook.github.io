<p>
	When you hear "Ca, Ca, Ca-runch" you know that this large, dark, blue-gray colored, flying bat-like creature is approaching.
	The Dactyl certainly isn't that easy to kill.
	Perhaps the eyes would be the right spot to aim for, probably with a <a href="../Items/Missile.html">missile</a> weapon of some sort.
	The Dactyl is often found in <a href="../Items/Jungle.html">Jungle</a> terrain and you better hope it doesn't spot you in the open.
