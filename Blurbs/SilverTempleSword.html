<p>
	This silver longsword has temple written all it. Well, not the words, but the carvings of so many religious symbols. These symbols are pretty worn and some are very obscured. Still, you're confident it would be welcomed in any treasure room. It is a <a href="../Items/Four.html">Damage Class 4</a> <a href="../Items/Edged.html">Edged</a> weapon and does additional damage against foes especially susceptible to silver weaponry. You can carry 1.
