<p>
	A sizable patch of <a href="../Items/LowHills.html">hilly</a> terrain is sometimes covered with a grove of Purpumpkins. Literally hundreds comprise the grove. The bulbous purple plants come in all sorts of roundish shapes and sizes. You select one that'll be sort of convenient to carry - you think that something like this has to have some wondrous use. You can carry 1.
