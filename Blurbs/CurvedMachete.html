	This is a nice tool to have when traveling in the <a href="../Items/Jungle.html">jungle</a>. Just hack and slash with a Curved Machete to ease your way through the rough terrain (equipping not necessary). It saves wear and tear on your Haversuit. The Curved Machete is fashioned by the <a href="../Locations/FarPost.html">Far Post</a> <a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html">Jossmen</a> and is usually acquired as a small gift from them. It is an <a href="../Items/Edged.html">Edged</a> Weapon of <a href="../Items/One.html">Damage Class 1</a>. You can carry 2.
