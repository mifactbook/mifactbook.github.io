<p>
	Killing a <a href="../Blurbs/JungleRattler.html">Jungle Rattler</a> gets you two Rattler Darts. You have to (very carefully) remove its fangs to get the darts. They are excellent projectiles when shot from a <a href="../Blurbs/BlowPipe.html">Blow Pipe</a> - <a href="../Items/Five.html">Damage Class 5</a>. However, because they are not perfectly straight, it takes more skill to hit with one than with a <a href="../Blurbs/ZinkiDart.html">Zinki Dart</a> (for example). You may carry 6 of these darts.
