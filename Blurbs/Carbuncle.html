<p>
	What?!? Carbunkle?!? Now you are in real trouble. Hope you said your prayers. But wait just a minute. That's not Carbunkle.
	That is A Carbuncle, a smallish creature of <a href="../Items/Swamp.html">Swampland</a> that is notorious for its extremely hard shell and nasty disposition.
	It may not be as tought as the original, but it will give you a very healthy fight.
