<p>
	Only a skilled Mage can create such an awesome killing machine from bones. The Death Warrior is the re-animated remains of a once-powerful warrior.
	It is still equipped with <a href="../Blurbs/BlackIronGreaves.html">Black Iron Greaves</a> and a rusty wheapon upon one of these fierce foes, beware the strength of nubers and the speed at which a demolished foe can rebuild its shattered frame.
