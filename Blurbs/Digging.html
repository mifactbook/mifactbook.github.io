		Diging is a lot of fun. First, you might fined buried treasure! (Highly unlikely.) Digging a hole 8-12 hands deep makes a <a href="../Locations/HideyHole.html">Hidey-Hole</a>. Dig deeper than that to make a <a href="../Locations/DeepPit.html">Deep Pit</a>.
		Twenty four (24) hands is as deep as you can go. Use the DIG order: D (Hands Deep). Hands Deep is how deep you want the hole to become. When you begin digging, you will select a spot that is already a depression or already been dug a bit (if you find one).
		Very wet terrains and very hard terrains tend to be unsuitable for digging. It may take as many as 8 Action Points per hand dug (based on what you dig with and what terrain you dig in). Still, there may be no good spot to dig, as it must be a site that members of
		your race (or group) can spot easily.
