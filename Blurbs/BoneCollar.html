<p>
	Displayed proudly by upstanding Mongers, this magical <a href="../Items/Amulets.html">Amulet</a> helps prevent <a href="../Items/Missile.html">Missiles</a> from hitting a Monger's neck and to a lesser degree shoulders and head. Only a Monger knows how to use this Amulet properly - other races cannot even equip it. You can carry 2.
