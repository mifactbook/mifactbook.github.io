	What's the colour of a forest and waiting behind a bush? These Green Iron Gauntlets if you ever intend to ambush someone. They blend perfectly with the forest and make you hard to see. Even better, they provide <a href="../Items/Three.html">Armour Class 3</a> protection for your hands (just in case you miss their neck and they bit your hands) and you can carry one pair.
