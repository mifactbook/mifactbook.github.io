<p>
	The Chomper is a close relative of the Muncher Beast.
	A digester of all things organic, it is really just a massive mastication machine.
	It stands a mere 10 hands tall, its body looking like a yellowish bipedal toad, but its mouth, which measures 6 x 8 hands, is more than enough to classify it as deadly.
	Its powerful jaws can chew up anything but rock, including monsters.
	Though not a naturally hostile creature, its voracious appetite makes it dangerous to be around.
