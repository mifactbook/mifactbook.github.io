<div class="info-section">
	<p>Every six or so turns, a male Monster will have built up too much internal gas and will want to release it in spectacular fashion. To do this, issue the NASTY FART order: NF. It takes no Action Points. Failure to issue the order will, sooner or later, result in the fart going off by itself - something to be avoided, as you may take damage from this. You will be warned during MAKE CAMP when you can successfully fart. Farts are quite loud - they can be heard up to one square away. Although there's more to farting than its imagined humor value, it will take you a while to learn exactly what.</p>
