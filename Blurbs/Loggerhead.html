title: Loggerheads
blurb: |
  <p>What's husky, puffy, beefy, burly and bulky? Oscar Meyer Xtra-Long Weiners? Wrong! It's the uncongenial, surly Loggerheads. This two-headed abomination of a Monster is slow (both physically and mentally) but strong and mean enough to bash your brains into Spam.
  Often equipped with a club and some armor, they relish attacking weaker Monsters and scream out their obnoxious <a href="../Blurbs/BattleCry.html">Battle Cry</a> as they attack. Although Loggerheads can take a lot damage, persistent attacks will finish 'em off,
  as they are slow to regain Health. They're also fond of yelling; this frequently results in giving away their location. Loggerheads always display their <a href="../Blurbs/TomkNecklace.html">Tomk Necklace</a> proudly.</p>
