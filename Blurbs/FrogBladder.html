<p>
	Kill a <a href="../Blurbs/WartFrog.html">Wart Frog</a> and you can have a measure of revenge by cutting out its oversize Frog Bladder. It looks like it would hold a copious quantity of liquid and, if tied off, would not spill. But would you really want to drink out of it? I think not. You can carry 4 of these rather disgusting items.
