<p>
	One of the ugly and vile <a href="../Blurbs/Mutates.html">Mutates</a>, this creature is an ill-fated attempt to merge the <a href="../Blurbs/MuckDaudler.html">Muck Daudler</a> with a <a href="../Blurbs/DemonCondor.html">Demon Condor</a>.
	The result is the aquatic winged menace known as the Demon Daudler. whether it is its tooth-line beak, its huge leathery wings, or its four paws ending in huge grasping talons, this beast is best left for the professionals.
	If you face one, take the advice of the one-armed <a href="../Blurbs/ZoingoMutant.html">Zoingot</a>...RUN!
