<p>
	The skin of a <a href="Gator.html"> Gator</a> is known for its toughness and can make a fine suit of body armor. To make it you'll need four <a href="GatorHide.html">Gator Hides</a>, a <a href="../Blurbs/Knife.html">Knife</a>, and you must be in a square having a Jute vine. Issue the MAKE order M 6 and it takes 42 Action Points to fashion. You may possess only one set of Gator Armor. The tough skin of the Gator makes this item <a href="../Items/Four.html">Armor Class 4</a>.
