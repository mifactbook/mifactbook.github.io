<p>
	Several hundred years ago, Gon Tonok, the fourth Lavodorian King, had his Magesmiths produce a <a href="../Items/Helmets.html">helmet</a> for his Royal Guard. Five spikelets stick out around the sides of the helm, giving it a fearsome look. Constructed from a blending of Iron, Gold and Kashart, the helm is nearly unbreakable. This helmet provides <a href="../Items/Four.html">Armour Class 4</a> protection. Sometimes your spikes will cause additional damage to a foe. You can carry 1.
