<p>
	This large, noble <a href="../Items/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> Beast can be a challenge to any Monster.
	Its light colour pattern and its ability to stand absolutely motionless for very long periods of time allow it to blend adroitly into the background of many terrains.
	Pray it doesn't find your tracks because the White Tiger is adept at stalking and <a href="../Blurbs/Wrestling.html">wrestling</a> down its prey.
	Equipped with razor-sharp claws and mauling jaws, you can expect a tough, bloody wrestling match.
