	<p>
		So you've ignored the <a href="../Blurbs/JossmanLoreMaster.html">Lore Master</a>, disturbed a <a href="../Locations/StoneCrypt.html">Stone Crypt</a>, killed a <a href="../Blurbs/SkeletalJossman.html">Skeletal Jossman</a> and are probably now wondering what has happened.
		Wherever you go <a href="../Blubs/Jossman.html">Jossmen</a> will be able to sense your foul presence. You will be unable to interact with any Far structures. Furthermore fellow monsters will feel more hostile towards you. If I were in your boots, I'd try and find a way to get rid of this curse pronto,
		before someone makes a ghost of you.
