<p>
	Sorting through the debris you come across a square piece of shining metal. Thinking it just another piece of junk, you prepare to toss it away. As you grab it, you notice a sturdy leather-wrapped handle. A more careful examination reveals you have found a cleaver such as those used by <a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html">Jossmen</a> to prepare meals at most <a href="../Locations/FarInn.html">Inns</a>. Only this is much larger. Not much of a weapon for a fine warrior such as yourself...yet...it has an interesting balance to it's great weight. Even better, it has retained a truely fine edge despite its mistreatment. The Butcher's Cleaver is a <a href="../Items/Three.html">Damage Class 3</a> <a href="../Items/Edged.html">Edged</a> Weapon. Its unusual dimensions require a Muscle of at least 80 to equip it. You can carry just one.
