<p>
	Imagine the odor of a hundred Ruks who have travelled the length and breadth of Monster Island with nary a shower or rain storm to wash them clean.
	Now imagine that stench gathered into a small bottle and allowed to ferment for a thousand years.
	Think that is bad? Well its nothing compared to the Stink Roach. An aroma that can only be described with gags, chokes, and spitting.
	The roach itself is not much of a fighter. Its prey usually falls dead just from the smell.
	If you find a bunch in an enclosed space, you better figure out how to make a Monster Island Gas Mask, otherwise you are in for an unpleasant experience.
