blurb: |
  <p>As expected, Mongers pride themselves on their ugliness. They grow even uglier with time. When you're scary to
  look at, the nasty creatures stay away. Mongers are superior <a href="../Blurbs/Wrestling.html">wrestlers</a> and pick up wrestling tricks much faster
  than other races. They've become the most independent of all the races and are the least communicative. They seem
  to have a knack for making things with iron - that's the best thing you can say about them.</p>
