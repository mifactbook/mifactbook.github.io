<p>
	Ever wonder why you never find tons of rotting creature carcasses all over the island? I mean, you kill 'em all the time and you can go back a day later and find nothing.
	The answer is the Carrion Maggot, the larvae of the <a href="../Blurbs/SpladderMoth.html">Giant Spladder Moth</a>.
	Okay, so maggots are flies and moths make caterpillars but this thing is so gross that it deserves to be called a maggot.
	It is slimey and smelly and not for anyone with a weak stomach.
