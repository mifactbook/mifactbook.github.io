<p>
	This small, almost delicate mallet is made of a rare gold and green specked marble only found deep below the ground. It rests so deep, that none have ever been able to dig it up. Quite a puzzle as you hold a piece in your hand. Along the sides of the mallet are symbols of <a href="../Items/Graggolos.html">gargoyles</a>. If there were any demi-god followers left in the world, maybe they would know where the marble came from. The striking surface has a strange 'soft' feel to it. Whatever this mallet was used to hit, must have had great value. It would be a fitting prize for any Temple treasury. You can carry 2, assuming no one takes them away from you.
