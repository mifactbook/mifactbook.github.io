<p>
	Catch one of these and you'll have the tastiest meal on this side of the Island. Lotsa leftovers too.
	One thing though: They're real tough to kill without a <a href="../Items/Pole.html">Spear</a> and they can knock the crap out of you in a charge.
	The Wild Boar comes in several skin tones, ranging from tan to dark grey. It's known to roam many types of terrain.
