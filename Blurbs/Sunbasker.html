<p>
	This rusty leaf-coloured lizard has a very big mouth. It's always on the lookout for an easy meal.
	As it attacks with its mouth, a distracting "gwopple" sound is emitted.
	The Sunbasker is found darting in and around <a href="../Items/Sea.html">coastal</a> areas. It's pretty easy to defeat in battle.
	Its tail is a tasty morsel. <a href="../Items/Bashing.html">Club</a> it!
