	<p>The front-line troops of <a href="../Items/Graggolos.html">Graggolos</a>, the Lesser Gargoyles are given one simple task: Destroy anyone or anything that seeks to defy the word of Graggolos. As a result, these creatures are single-minded berzerkers and, given that they are composed of solid stone, they are more than capable of completing their mission.</p>
