<p>
	This large, lycanthropic cat is not the creature you want to do battle with when you're under the weather. It senses weakness nd goes for the jugular.
	Beware of the cat's poisonous bite. Wield silver weapons against it and equip yourself with silver types of armour.
	Better yet, be smart enough to flee.
