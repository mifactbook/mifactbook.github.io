title: Bridge Trolls
blurb: |
  <p>A close relative of Gorge Trolls, these colossal beings are an unmoveable wall of pure fighting power. Were you to seriously annoy one and get in a fight, after you'd blunted your weapon on it, it'd simply crush you with its huge fists.
  They are fortunately very friendly, as attacking any monster would decrease the profits from their lucrative bridge 'operating' business. What they spend the Oculars on is anybody's guess, as they seem
  to spend most of their non-patrolling time fishing or sleeping. (Loud snoring can often be heard coming from the back of the troll booth).</p>
