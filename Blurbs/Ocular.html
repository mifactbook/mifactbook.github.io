<p>
	Each Ocular is a perfectly shaped Rosyte stone, approximately 1/6 of a hand in diameter. You can carry a maximum of 2000 of these coins. Scribed (or stamped) on the obverse side is the picture of some king (very hard to make out). The reverse side bears these words: &quot;One Ocular&quot; and &quot;Lavodorian Treasury - The Civilized Kingdom&quot;.
