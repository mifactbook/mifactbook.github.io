<p>
	Roosting(?) on the ceilings of caves, usually the larger ones, is the small Blood Mite.
	About 4 hands long, sucker-like arms enable it to grip most anything and jump most anywhere.
	Often one'll drop atop you and try to affix its ugly red mouth to your neck.
	The Blood Mite just loves Monster blood and screeches loudly during its attack.
