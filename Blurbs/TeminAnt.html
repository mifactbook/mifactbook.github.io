<p>
	This is not a bug. This is the god of all bugs. What has the Island come to when a poor Ruk has to face a bug that gives the average Ruk ego a complex.
	The Termin-Ant is all attitude, strength, and oh yeah... nearly 4 hands of pincher.
	It snaps tree trunks off in a single bite and these are <a href="../Items/HighJungle.html">High Jungle</a> trunks.
	You knew getting up today was a bad idea. This beast is going prove it. Termin-Ants can be detected at a safe distance if the Ruk is paying attention.
	The rubbing of their attenna makes a sound similar to a deep Ruk voice repeating over and over. "I'll be back!" A <a href="../Items/Pole.html">Pole</a> Class weapon is the only possible option.
	Termin-Ants are normally found in High Jungle, but most folks don't argue if the Termin-Ant wants to live somewhere else.
