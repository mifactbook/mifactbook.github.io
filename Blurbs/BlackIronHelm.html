<p>
	Here's an item for those who wish to live in the shadows - the Black Iron <a href="../Items/Helmets.html">Helm</a>. It comes with a flat black finish that makes it hard to see and it provides excellent protection for your head in battle. You can carry two of them and they provide you with <a href="../Items/Three.html">Armor Class 3</a> protection.
