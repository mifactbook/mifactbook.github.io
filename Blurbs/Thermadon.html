<p>
	Living in the <a href="../Items/Sticks.html">Sticks</a>, this mid-sized lizard is a danger to all who pass within range of its nose.
	It particularly dislikes hunters and gatherers. About 8 hands in length, on rare occasions it attacks with its claws.
	Usually, it slashes at you with its tail. Where you find one Thermadon, you'll find plenty more nearby.
