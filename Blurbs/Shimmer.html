<p>
	If you are a little tired and suffering from a lack of water, a Shimmer may look more like a mirage in the desert than a dangerous foe.
	This creature is almost insubstantial and doesn't hit with a lot of power. But its lack of power is made up for by its overwhelming speed.
	Hitting one is not easy to do so you must maintain your composure, keep a steady eye, and swing like mad.
