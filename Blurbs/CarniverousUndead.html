<div class="info-section">
	<p>Carniverous Undead are the most sickening of the Undead creations. They are vaguely recognisable as once having been Monsters, but are horribly disfigured by the change into undeath.
	The tongue becomes long and tough for licking the marrow from cracked bones, the teeth lengthen and grow sharp, and the nails sharpen into claws. These creatures have an undying hatred of life that can only be quenched by the flesh of the living.
	Any young Monster will do, but especially Fatblobs. Many believe the foul creatures were trapped in the catacombs by the followers of <a href="../Items/Graggolos.html">Graggolos</a>.</p>
