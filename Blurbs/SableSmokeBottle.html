<p>
	Sitting before you is an ornate bottle. In and of itself, the bottle looks to be worth more than a few <a href="../Blurbs/Ocular.html">Oculars</a>. The strange smoke that seems to swell and contract within just makes it more desirable. Once opened and activated using a <a href="../Blurbs/SparkSprig.html">Spark Sprig</a> the concoction has a most dramatic effect. It changes your <a href="../Blurbs/Mounts.html">Mount</a> into an entirely different creature. The <a href="../Blurbs/Wizards.html">Wizards</a> have learned to control the reaction to a small degree. A few creature results can be repeated with reasonable success. Wizards may sell a more random concoction for those who like adventure. Carefully insert a Spark Sprig inside your bottle to Polymorph your boring, old mount (It may object). Issue the order: M (Bottle#). You can carry but one of any bottle type (Smoke colour).
