	This small, great looking statuette depicts a full-winged dragon resting its magnificent clawed feet. It's somewhat frightening to look at because the carving is so realistic - you almost expect it to come alive at any moment. The greatly skilled carver made it from klinwood (it's very solid and heavy) and polished or lacquered it in some way that its surface is both very hard and somewhat shiny. It even glows slightly in the dark. Naturally this statue would be a welcome addition to any god's Temple Treasure Room. Still you might wish to hold on to it instead. You may carry 1.
