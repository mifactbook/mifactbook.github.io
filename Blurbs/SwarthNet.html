<p>
	This is used both for fishing from a raft and to entangle an opponent in battle. These nets are incredibly strong and durable. This item is hand-crafted by <a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html">Jossmen</a> and for sale at some of their <a href="../Locations/FarInn.html">Far Inns</a>. You can carry one net. It is an <a href="../Items/Two.html">Armor Class 2</a> <a href="../Items/Defense.html">Defensive</a> Weapon. What makes this net even more useful is that it happens to be perfect for capturing some creatures...except for a few that'll rip it to shreds (and perhaps you with it).
