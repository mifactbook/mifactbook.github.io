title: Fatblobs
blurb: |
  <p>Fatblobs are the shortest and friendliest race. Sure they're the fattest (pleasantly plump?) and yeah, they don't bathe regularly. So what!
  While they sleep their fragrant body odor helps keep unfriendlies away. Being crack foragers, they have more to eat. They also <a href="../Blurbs/NastyFart.html">fart</a> more often, which could be valuable.
  A long term advantage is that they recover Spell Points somewhat faster than other races.  Unfortunately, Fatblobs are not known for their
  speed, and in cases where it's better to run than fight, they may sit down and have a snack instead!</p>
