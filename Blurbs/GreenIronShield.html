<p>
	Created especially for the Elven Armies loyal to the Lavadorian Kings during the Demi-God Wars, this<a href="../Items/Defensive.html">shield</a> is the color of a forest and is a sight to behold. It provides <a href="../Items/Four.html">Armor Class 4</a> protection and, when viewed against a background of vegetation, it makes the bearer very difficult to see. You can carry one.
