	The Forger notices you have a few coins in your possession and grins. He explains that in addition to putting a coat of silver on some of your weapons, he also knows the secret of coating them with Iron.
	The main disadvantage is that the items are less effective against creatures that take silver to hit. On the plus side, Iron is heavy and the extra weight adds a Damage Class to the basic weapon.
	The Forger charges 100 <a href="../Blurbs/Ocular.html">Oculars</a> to coat the items with iron and you must pump the bellows (80 APs). Issue the Make order: M (Item#) in a <a href="../Locations/FarForge.html">Forge</a> square
</p>

<p>Note: you need the basic item that's not silver coated</p>

	The Smite Pike has long been considered on of the most deadly weapons that could be constructed using natural creature parts. And as always, one can count on a Jossmen to find a way do things better than the average Monster.
	The Iron Smite Pike is a deadly example of Forge Master skill. A thick coating of Iron, ground to a razor point, and then polished mirror bright. The added weight of the Iron allows the Iron Smite Pike to strike harder and penetrate deeper.
	It also makes the Pike nearly unbreakable. The Iron Smite Pike is a <a href="../Items/Five.html">Damage Class 5</a> <a href="../Items/Pole.html">Pole</a> Weapon. You can only carry 1.
