<p>
	The Mudcat is not your typical feline. It has no sleek fur, no gentle yet powerful grace, no deep rumbling growl.
	It does, however, have an awesomely powerful set of jaws equipped with an ugly set of incisors that are more than capable of biting holes in your cranium and ripping flesh off your bones.
	Combine that with claws the length of your forearm and this is one ferocious foe that is not for the meek or mild or inexperienced.
