<p>
	Lurking in the depths of some <a href="../Locations/Quicksand.html">quicksand</a> lies the dreaded Tentaculus.
	A writhing mass of tentacles surround a vicious beaked maw.
	Its tentacles will attempt to pull you under and drown you, which is probably more pleasant than being eaten alive via its maw.
	An <a href="../Items/Edged.html">edged</a> weapon is your best bet for attempting to chop through its tough tentacles.
	Should you manage to kill it, then you may collect the severed tentacles (If you can find them in the muck).
