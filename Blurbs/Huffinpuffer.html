<p>
	This hunchbacked simian predator lurks in <a href="../Items/LowHills.html">hilly</a> and <a href="../Items/Sticks.html">Sticks</a> terrain.
	Approaching prey gets knocked over by a sudden blast of air from its powerful lungs, after which the Huffinpuffer leaps out to finish the job.
	These creatures are cunning and fairly strong, and only the best <a href="../Blurbs/Wrestling.html">wrestling</a> tactics will stop one from twisting a monster into a nice pretzel shape.
	Its humped back makes it almost impossible to pin.
