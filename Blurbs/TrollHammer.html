<p>
	From deep in the deepest <a href="../Blurbs/ZoingoMutant.html">Zoingot</a> <a href="../Locations/MineShaft.html">Mine</a>, the rythmic pounding of the Troll Hammer is a sound that lets the master know the slaves are at work. It also spells big trouble for those venturing into areas they do not belong. For the average Ruk, this is simply an awesome <a href="../Items/Six.html">Damage Class 6</a> <a href="../Items/Bashing.html">Bashing</a> weapon that will give your opponent a Troll-sized headache. Because of its large size, you need at least 450 muscle to use one in battle. You can carry one.
