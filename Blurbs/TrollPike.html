	Now this is a weapon for a BIG monster. At nearly 20 hands in length and big around as your wrist, it is waaay too big for the average Ruk to carry about. Too bad, too, since it does Damage Class 7 damage in battle. Still if you are up to the task of having 850 muscle and can use such an advanced weapon, it can be an awedome addition to you armament. Beware though, only a Troll King usually carries one and they can turn you into a Ruk-kabob in seconds with their advanced skill and muscle. Needless to say, you can only carry one.
