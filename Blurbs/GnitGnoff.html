<p>
	Once a swarm of <a href="../Blurbs/GnitGnat.html">Gnitgnats</a> latch on to you they can be a real pain. Every week one of their number breaks off and attacks you. Now, there is something you can do about this unpleasant situation. Just make your- self a batch of Gnitgnoff (pronounced ga-nit-ga-noff). This Voodoo concoction can be obtained by mixing 1 <a href="../Blurbs/GuanoPlasm.html">Guano Plasm</a>, 1 <a href="../Blurbs/PurpleLotusLeaf.html">Purple Lotus Leaf</a>, and 1 <a href="../Blurbs/Oil.html">Oil</a> into a Cauldron. Stir for 4 Action Points. To make, write the MAKE order: M 98. To consume, write the USE/CONSUME order: U 98. Consuming Gnitgnoff changes your scent, causing the Gnitgnat swarm following you to leave the area. You can carry 7 batches.
