<p>
	Some call this buzzard "<a href="../Items/Shroud.html">Shroud's</a> Pet" because of its incredibly evil appearance.
	The fact that it is a scavenger of dead animals adds to its fearsome reputation. Ghoul Buzzards seem to sense when death is nearby.
	It is uncommon for more than one to appear at a time. They are so vicious they even attack each other.
	From time to time, when they are hungry enough, a Ghoul Buzzard will attack another living being.
	However it will not eat the fresh meat, leaving the flesh to decay for a few days before feasting. Capturing a Ghoul Buzzard is not easy.
