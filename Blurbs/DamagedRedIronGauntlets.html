<p>
	These Damaged Red Iron <a href="../Items/Gauntlets.html">Gauntlets</a> have been used and abused. Sure, they'll give <a href="../Items/Two.html">Armor Class 2</a> Protection, but when attended to by a <a href="../Locations/FarForge.html">Forger</a>, they can do even better. You can carry just one pair.
