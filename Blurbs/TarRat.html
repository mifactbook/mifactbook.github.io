<p>
	Often found in and around <a href="../Locations/TarPit.html">Tar Pits</a>, this 5-8 hand long, tar-encrusted rodent is ever-ready to remove an intruder with its unusually long teeth.
	Chomp, chomp. Nibble, nibble. Chew.
	It is excellent at surprising a foe because it has somehow learned how to live in the air-pockets of the Tar Pits. <a href="../Items/Bashing.html">Bash</a> away to win the day.
