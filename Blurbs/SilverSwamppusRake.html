	Finding that your <a href="../Blurbs/SwamppusRake.html">Swamppus Rake</a> isn't all its cracked up to be? Speaking of cracked, the claws of the <a href="../Blurbs/Swamppus.html">Swamppus</a> tend to break off frequently leaving you with a rather worthless foot. Too make matters worse, the rake is fairly ineffective against Undead and other creatures that require Silver weapons. Luckily for a price, the <a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html">Jossmen</a> ForgeMasters have a process that places a thin coating of Silver over the claws making them stronger and more effective. The ForgeMaster even engraved the Silver to add a touch of beauty to the weapon. The Silver Swamppus Rake is a <a href="../Items/Three.html">Damage Class 3</a> <a href="../Items/Pointed.html">Pointed</a> Weapon. You can carry only 1.
