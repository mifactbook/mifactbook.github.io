<p>
	This is what's better than a <a href="../Blurbs/LargeClamShell.html">Large Clam Shell</a> for digging. To make one you'll need a Spear to expend (a <a href="../Blurbs/CrudeSpear.html">Crude Spear</a> will do), and be in a square having a Tuvian Plant. Spend 2 Action Points to locate and then precisely slam your Spear into the odd-shaped Tuvian root. If you do it just right it will stay stuck and you've got yourself a capable shovel (after the root has hardened). Issue the MAKE order: M 26. You can carry one Tuvian Shovel.
