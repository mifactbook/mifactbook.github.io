<p>
	Talk about your pretty pink flower. And what a relaxing scent. That is till you step a little closer.
	The large green mat that surrounds the blossom is all part of the hideous trap.
	One tiny step forward and WHAMM!!!!! This rather nasty flower closes around you.
	Its acid begins to disolve many body parts the average Ruk is rather attached to.
	Should you be strong enough or an above average <a href="../Blurbs/Wrestling.html">wrestler</a>, you may survive.
	Otherwise, it will only hurt for a minute. The good news is that you won't need a tombstone.... there won't be anything left to place under it.
