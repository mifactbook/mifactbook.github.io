<p>
	When exploring one of the <a href="../Locations/SmallCave.html">small caves</a>, it is somewhat likely that you'll find a part of the cave's wall covered with Black Cave Spore. If you've a <a href="../Blurbs/ToothSabre.html">Tooth Sabre</a>, you'll automatically try to pry off a couple of the hard-to-find spores of this fungi. You can carry up to three clumps of spores.
