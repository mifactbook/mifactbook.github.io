<p>
	When in <a href="../Items/Jungle.html">Jungle</a> or <a href="../Items/SandPalms.html">Sand & Palms</a> terrain, be on the lookout for a large, muddy brown, hairy vine.
	Chances are it's a Crobbler. Something that'll give you a good fight. Maybe two good fights. Maybe more.
	You have to be a superior <a href="../Blurbs/Wrestling.html">wrestler</a> to defeat this horrible growth.
