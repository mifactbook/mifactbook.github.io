<p>
	Tired of that lame <a href="../Blurbs/DactylWhip.html">Dactyl Whip</a> that just doesn't cut it with the tougher foes? Here is the answer for you.
	The Grasping Scourge. Made from 8 <a href="../Blurbs/TentaculusTentacle.html">Tentaculus Tentacles</a> and 4 <a href="../Blurbs/Squzskin.html">Squzskins</a>, this nasty weapon does <a href="../Items/Five.html">Level 5</a>
	<a href="../Items/Whip.html">Whip</a> damage. If you find yourself in possession of the required items, issue the MAKE Order: M 214. You will set about using the squzskins to fashion a nice, comfortable handle to which you
	will firmly attach the 8 tentacles. When used, the suckers on the tentacles will grasp at the skin or armour of your foes and, if you are skillful, pull off a nice-sized piece or two. You can carry only one.
