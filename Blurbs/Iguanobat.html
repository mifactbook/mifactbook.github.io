<p>
	Nope, this is not some kind of batlizard like the <a href="../Blurbs/NgEcho.html">Ng'Echo</a>. This bat is the source of fertilizer than Carbunkle.
	In fact, for each pound of food, this thing will produce five pounds of poop, making it capable of pooping itself right out of a place to live.
	The long-dead Toltomatecs used to prize this species which may explain why no-one liked the Toltomatecs.
