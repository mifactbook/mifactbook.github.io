<p>
	Pure, concentrated evil. Nothing else describes the Bereaver. When it attacks, it leaves nothing but sorrow and death in its wake.
	It gets its name from the bereaved family and group members you will leave behind.
	It attacks with wicked claws and savage fangs and it comes from the deep shadows, never letting you get a clear look at it.
	If you travel in the lands of the Bereaver, be sure you have tidied up all your personal affairs and update your will.
