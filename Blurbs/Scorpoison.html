<p>
	Killing a <a href="../Blurbs/ForkTailedScorpion.html">scorpion</a> nets you some of its poison. This can then be used to poison a <a href="../Locations/Waterhole.html">Waterhole</a>. When you've acquired at least 15 Scorpoison you can issue the USE order: U 141. This will have you dump all of your Scorpoison into the Waterhole. Poisoning a Waterhole is an evil act. (You are fore- warned!) You can carry 20 doses.
