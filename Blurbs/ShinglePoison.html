<p>
	The thought of coating a weapon of yours with a nasty, poisonous substance has been in the back of your mind for quite some time. You can now create Shingle Poison by combining 2 <a href="../Blurbs/AcornHeart.html">Acorn Hearts</a> and 2 <a href="../Blurbs/Oil.html">Oil</a> in a <a href="../Blurbs/VoodooCauldron.html">Voodoo Cauldron</a>. To do this, issue the MAKE order: M 62 and expend 16 Action Points. This produces 2 batches of Shingle Poison. You can carry 4 batches. To use, issue the EQUIP order: E 62, and you will put a batch of it on your already equipped <a href="../Items/Edged.html">Edged</a>, <a href="../Items/Pointed.html">Pointed</a>, or <a href="../Items/Pole.html">Pole</a> weapon just before hand-to-hand battle next occurs. This is extremely fast-acting poison that causes more damage to be inflicted - the poison does not linger in the victim.
