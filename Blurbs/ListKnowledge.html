	<p>As time goes by, memory dims or vanishes altogether, leaving monsters with fits of senility wondering if they ever knew some vital tidbit. Fortunately, you have the amazing capacity to remember almost anything if you put your mind to it. If you find your mental faculties failing, issue the LIST KNOWLEDGE Order (LK) and you will spend some time wrenching thoughts and memories from that little Ruk-sized brain of yours. It is free of cost in Action Points. To minimize wear and tear on your cerebrum, you will only dredge up knowledge that does not include Creatures, Items, or Spells which can be easily remembered from your Reference Sheet.</p>
