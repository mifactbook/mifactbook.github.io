<p>
	This grizzly creature makes its home in bamboo-thick areas. Its long, flat body is carried about on 12 short, stubby legs.
	Its belly drags along the ground, making a scraping noise as it moves.
	Its hind-most legs are longer than the others, giving it the ability to perform a powerful leap when it spots its prey.
	It will attack nearly anything, but leap away quickly if it senses it is losing the encounter.
	Its spike-covered legs thrash away at a foe and can cause much damage. Turn it into steak.
