<p>
	Circling high over the <a href="../Items/Wasteland.html">Wastelands</a> of Monster Island are is usually a flock of these vile and repugnant creatures.
	Carrion Vultures love to feast on the dead and not so dead that survived the tragedy of the Wasting.
	If you happen to be trudging through this terrain, beware, because this creature can cause you a lot of pain.
