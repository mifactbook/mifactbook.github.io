<p>
	Tired of your head taking a pounding in your <a href="../Blurbs/SquzskinHelmet.html">Squzskin Helm</a>? Looking for a little bit of extra protection? Then you need a Worm-Plate Helm. Just take 8 <a href="../Blurbs/WormPlate.html">Worm Plates</a> and attach them to your Squzskin Helm. It is really easy to do since each plate has a set of sharp prickles on the back side that seem to have an affinity for <a href="../Blurbs/Squzskin.html">Squzskin</a>. This will take you about 15 Action Points to complete. When done, the Worm-Plate Helm will provide <a href="../Items/Two.html">Class 2</a> protection for that valuable little head of yours. You can carry 2.
