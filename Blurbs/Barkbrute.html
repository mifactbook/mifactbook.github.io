<p>
	Camoflaged in the <a href="../Items/Sticks.html">Sticks</a>, a Barkbrute can be nearly impossible to spot until it is too late. It's covered with sharp shards; these are its main weapon. It lumbers up to you on two strong legs and grabs onto your body..to crush you onto its shards.
	<a href="../Items/Pointed.html">Pointed weapons</a> seem best against this seven hand tall Creature.
