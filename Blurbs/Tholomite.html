<p>
	Picture a giant eight-legged insect, about 6 hands tall, with very sharp pincers extending from its bulbous head.
	Flattened feet enable it to dig a lair in the soft soil of <a href="../Items/SandPalms.html">Sand & Palms</a> terrain.
	A hardened exoskeleton offers it considerable protection when attacked.
	When its pincers grab onto an arm or leg, say good-bye to that limb! The weapon of choice against it is likely any <a href="../Items/Edged.html">Edged</a> Weapon.
