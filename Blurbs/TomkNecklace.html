<p>
	This item is a symbol of identity to a <a href="../Blurbs/Loggerhead.html">Loggerhead</a>. It's made of all sorts of knickknacks: A stray (damaged) <a href="../Blurbs/BitCoin.html">Bit Coin</a>, a hollow hoop, a <a href="../Blurbs/HawkBuzzard.html">Hawk Buzzard</a> feather, etc. It's smelly and not without some crawling insects. As a Loggerhead plunges through life he'll add and add to it. If you kill a Loggerhead you'll take this necklace - a <a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html"> Jossman</a> Bounty item. You can carry 6.
