<p>
	If you find a Strawbin plant in <a href="../Items/LowHills.html">Low Hills</a> terrain, you can easily and quickly assemble a couple of torches. Torches are needed to explore dark places, such as caves or tombs.Simply by being in Low Hills terrain where a Strawbin plant is located allows you to acquire up to four Torches at no cost in Action Points. This is performed automatically. When you've found a dark place to explore, just issue the USE order: U 33. You will then use your Torch to search and explore the dark location. You can carry 4 Torches.
