<p>
	This is the massive, gnarly club wielded by a <a href="../Blurbs/Loggerhead.html">Loggerhead</a>. Little work went into making this weapon, it's simply a branch from a tree. Its shape and balance make it unusable by other Monster races. Further, tremendous Muscle would be required to carry it. The Logbat is a Damage Class 3 Bashing Weapon. Should you acquire a Logbat as the result of spoils from a battle, you'll fling this useless item aside.
