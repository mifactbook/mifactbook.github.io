<p>
	Yuck. what a nasty, smelly, slimey, ugly creature.
	The Eight-fanged Leech is a blood-sucking monstrosity that can think of nothing sweeter than the blood or a ripe Ruk with which to make its meal.
	It accomplishes this by slapping its hideous sucking disc on your neck and plunging its mouth full of fangs deep into your hide.
