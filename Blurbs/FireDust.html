<p>
	This is the remains or perhaps the raw form of dragonfire from a dead <a href="../Blurbs/Dragon.html">Dragon</a>'s stomach. It looks like very tiny sparkling black beads, and has a strange, powerful smell to it. A Magesmith might use 500 or 1000 beads of Fire Dust when creating a particular magical item. The legendary Black <a href="../Blurbs/Voodoo.html">Voodoo</a> Master, Xanxu, discovered several Black Voodoo uses for this exotic dust. There's no limit to the amount of dust you can carry.
