<p>
	Made of the purest silver, Silver Beads are a staple in the <a href="../Locations/FarForge.html">Forging</a> business. In the hands of a good forger, a handful of these can be worked into rings, weapons and armor. Each with properties which protect the wearer from the Undead. In its current forms, Silver Beads are not particularly useful to a monster like you but most races are willing to buy them for their own use. You can carry 100 silver beads.
