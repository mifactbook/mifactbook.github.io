<p>
	The Forger notices you have a few coins in your possession and grins. He explains that in addition to putting a coat of silver on some of your weapons, he also knows the secret of coating them with Iron.
	The main disadvantage is that the items are less effective against creatures that take silver to hit. On the plus side, Iron is heavy and the extra weight adds a Damage Class to the basic weapon.
	The Forger charges 100 <a href="../Blurbs/Ocular.html">Oculars</a> to coat the items with iron and you must pump the bellows (80 APs). Issue the Make order: M (Item#) in a <a href="../Locations/FarForge.html">Forge</a> square
</p>

<p>Note: you need the basic item that's not silver coated</p>
