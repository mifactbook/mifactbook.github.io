<p>
	These smallish, cute, cuddly-looking bears are not the friendly ones you'd expect. Oh, no. No, no, no.
	Each comes complete with a set of meat-hungry teeth and very sharp "shredding" type paws. Pick one up and be disemboweled in a prompt manner.
	Its favorite habitat are palm trees in hilly terrain. It makes various "Coo-coo" noises to attract unsuspecting prey.
