title: Automatic Sell Order
blurb: |
  <p>After years of boycotts and complaining, the <a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html">Jossman</a> Trade Union has heard your voice and instituted the AUTOMATIC SELL Order. Issue the order: AS (Item#), and when you come upon a Far Structure,
  the proprietor will let you review your list and automatically sell off the items you have listed. What a time saver. To remove an item from the list, just issue the order again. You can list up to 20 items for automatic sale.
  This order will cost you zero action points.</p>
