<p>
	This finely crafted hand-carved statuette exudes a warm feeling when it's in your hands (if you're a Fuvite). The carver captured <a href="../Items/Fuvah.html">Fuvah</a>'s likeness in a very glorious and illustrious manner.
	What a treasure! The statue is made from a large block of Klinwood and is polished or lacquered in some way that its surface is both very hard and somewhat shiny, giving it a slight radiant glow. Such a statue has one proper place:
	a <a href="../Items/Fuvah.html">Fuvah Temple</a> Treasure Room. In fact, it's very important for a Fuvah Temple to have one of these statues. You can carry 1.
