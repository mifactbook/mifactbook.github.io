<p>
	This orange and black <a href="../Items/Jungle.html">Jungle</a> snake loves to cling to the bodies of larger Creatures and Monsters.
	About 6 hands long, it's not so dangerous in battle because its bite isn't severe or poisonous.
	However, it can take a lot of damage and is one of the scarier-looking varieties of snake.
	A <a href="../Items/Whip.html">Whip</a> Weapon is best against it.
