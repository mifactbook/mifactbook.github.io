<p>
	Once the most important part of a White Knight's Armor, this <a href="../Items/Defensive.html">shield</a> appears to have met an unkind fate, along with its previous owner. It is dented and abraded and needs the attention of a good <a href="../Locations/FarForge.html">Forger</a>. Still, it holds some shine and will provide <a href="../Items/Two.html">Armor Class 2</a> protection to its wearer. You can carry one.
