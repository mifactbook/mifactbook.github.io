<p>
	Have you met an extremely dangerous giant spider yet? Well shake legs with a Xanxu creation! Fast, agile, and quick to lash its spindly legs at you, this superior cave denizen takes on all comers.
	Brandishing <a href="../Items/Pole.html">Pole</a> Weapons against it would be smart. Smarter still is to run away.
