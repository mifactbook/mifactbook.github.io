<p>
	One of the more evil species of snake to inhabit the Island, the Snapper Snake is its own little whip.
	It coils itself back on itself and when it strikes, it whips its head full of fangs towards it's foe and buries them deep in some soft, vital organ.
	It then snaps it's head back with a loud 'POP!' usually pulling a hunk of meat with it.
