<p>
	This hideous representative of spiderdom is easily the biggest, nastiest, smelliest spider to walk the Island.
	It has a massive, bloated, hairy body with eight enormous, multi-jointed legs.
	Its head has almost 100 eyes that can stare down a herd of <a href="../Blurbs/Plodder.html">Plodders</a> and its crushing mandibles can crush stone to dust.
	In addition, it has a nasty habit of spitting hot tar at its prey, burning and poisoning them to death.
