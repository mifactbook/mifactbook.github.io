<p>
	Have you ever seen eyes floating along the surface off a large <a href="../Locations/Pond.html">pond</a>? Them's Bortolatomus eyes.
	Like an iceberg, what's beneath the surface is far, far bigger than what's not.
	Not only do they pose a problem to anyone who enters the water but they have been seen elevated on four fin-like claws, chasing a Monster onto land.
	Stopping one of these deadly Creatures often takes a <a href="../Items/Missile.html">Missile</a> weapon to the eye or a miracle.
	Sometimes both! The only sound they make is the rush of escaping air as they surface to chew you up.
