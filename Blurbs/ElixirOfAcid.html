<p>
	This item certainly puts a new spin on elixirs. Whatever you do, don't drink it. It'd eat you from the inside out. Instead you use it as a <a href="../Items/Missile.html">missile</a> weapon to do some special damage. This may be the most potent missile weapon you will ever come across. To make it, you must mix two <a href="../Blurbs/WhiteLotusElixir.html">White Lotus Elixir</a>, two <a href="../Blurbs/TurgidToadstool.html">Turgid Toadstools</a> and one <a href="../Blurbs/BlackCaveSpore.html">Black Cave Spore</a> in your <a href="../Blurbs/VoodooCauldron.html">Voodoo Cauldron</a> and mix them for 18 AP (issue the M 264 order). After that, you equip it like any other weapon. It is a <a href="../Items/Two.html">Damage Class 2</a> weapon but does extra damage on contact. You can carry up to six.
