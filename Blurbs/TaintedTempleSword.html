<p>
	This silver long sword has Temple written all over it. However it appears that the silver of the blade has been corrupted in some manner since its forging. The blade is now tinted with an eerie blood-red taint. Despite the discolouration you feel this item would be welcome in any Temple Treasure Room. It is a <a href="../Items/Four.html">Damage Class 4</a> <a href="../Items/Edged.html">Edged</a> weapon. It should still do additional damage against creatures susceptible to silver. You can carry just one.
