<p>
	Weapons made from creature parts are very basic to every Monster's inventory. They are the mark of creativity and pride. They also tend to be rather unreliable. No matter how skillful the Monster, pieces of dead things tend to break.
	If only you could make them tougher and add a little to their punch. Count on the <a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html">Jossmen</a> to make your wishes come true and take your coins. The Forgemaster explains that he can place a thin coat
	of Silver on some weapons to enhance them. He charges 50 <a href="../Blurbs/Ocular.html">Oculars</a> for the Silver and you must pump the bellows (50 APs). Issue a Make order: M Item#.

	Note: You must be at a <a href="../Locations/FarForge.html">Forge</a> with the item you wish to Silver Plate
