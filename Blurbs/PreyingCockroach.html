<p>
	Standing nearly 18 hands in height, this abombination of nature is equipped with glistening brown fore arms edged in razor sharp spines.
	Its jaws are lined with thousands of jagged teeth, easily enough to take a huge bite out of your cranium, or maybe even bite your head right off.
	If you are unfortunate enough to ever meet one of these, you will be witness to an unnatural quiet right before battle as all other roaches and creatures bow their head in praise of the meal you are about to provide them.
