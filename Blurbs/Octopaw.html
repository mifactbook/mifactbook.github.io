<p>
	What's worse than a <a href="../Blurbs/Tentaculus.html">Tentaculus</a> armed with incredibly strong gripping tentacles or a <a href="../Blurbs/DoublePawedCougar.html">Double-Pawed Cougar</a> with huge sharp claws? Try this Mutate that is a cross between the two! This squid-like being is armed with eight huge tentacles capable of pulling a monster limb from limb.
	But worse yet, each tentacle ends in a huge furry paw and eight razor sharp claws.
	Top it off with a mouth full of feline teeth and you have the horror that is the Octopaw. To kill one, you'd better work on your stab-and-move.
	Otherwise you'll be so much kitty-litter...or is that squid food?
