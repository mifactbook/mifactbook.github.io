<p>
	This powerful magic ring, when equipped, allows you (and your Mount, if you're riding one) to blend into the background of most any terrain. This makes it very hard for others to see you at a distance, allowing you to slip through ambushes, avoid accidental encounters, and sleep much safer whilst camped. Magical treasures such as this can be placed in any god's Temple Treasure room. You can carry any number of rings.
