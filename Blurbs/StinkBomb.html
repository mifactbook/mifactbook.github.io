<p>
	Tired of those weak little <a href="../Blurbs/FartBomb.html">Fart Bombs</a>? Ready for something that does a little bit more damage with a little greater style? You might try a stink bomb.
	To make one is easy, just issue the M 462 order and you will stew up one Stink Bomb with two <a href="../Blurbs/Oil.html">oil</a> in your <a href="../Items/Vessels.html">voodoo cauldron</a>. Y
	ou will carefully add the resulting mixture to a Fart Bomb. It will take you 20 Action Points per bomb and you can carry up to six. It is a <a href="../Items/Four.html">Class 4</a> <a href="../Items/Missile.html">Missile</a>
	Weapon but the Stink Bomb will help you do a little extra damage and maybe even leave a lasting impression.
