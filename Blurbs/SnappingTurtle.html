<p>
	Larger cousin to the <a href="../Blurbs/GiantTortoise.html">Giant Tortoise</a>, the Snapping Turtle can be best described as attitude on the half-shell.
	Always in a nasty temper, the Snapping Turtle will attempt to bite anything that moves in its vicinity.
	Its muscular jaws are strong enough to snap bone in a single bite.
	A <a href="../Items/Pole.html">pole</a> weapon might be best to keep this unpleasant creature at a distance until you kill it.
