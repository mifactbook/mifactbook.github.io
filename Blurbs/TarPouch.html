<p>
	When you're in a square havinmg a <a href="../Locations/TarPit.html">Tar Pit</a>, issue the MAKE order: M 136. This takes 3 Action Points and you need a <a href="../Blurbs/CheesmoPouch.html">Cheesmo Pouch</a> - you'll carefully fill the pouch with tar. You can carry three Tar Pouches. To set a Tar Trap, you must first be at a square containing a <a href="../Locations/Trail.html">Path or Trail</a> crossing through it. You need a Tar Pouch, a <a href="../Blurbs/JuteRope.html">Jute Rope</a>, a <a href="../Blurbs/SpiderSpring.html">Spider Spring</a> and a <a href="../Blurbs/SparkSprig.html">Spark Sprig</a>. Lay the rope across the trail (as a trip wire), tieing one end to a tree. Fasten the other end to the Spark Sprig. Very carefully, insert the sprig into the Tar Pouch. Also, place the spring beneath the pouch (for extra velocity - to make sure the pouch reaches its target). To do all of this, issue the USE order: U 136. It takes 2 Action Points. Someone is going to be very surprised! Heh, heh.
