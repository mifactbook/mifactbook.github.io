<p>
	This large, swift, yellow-spotted, black snake is found in <a href="../Items/Jungle.html">Jungle</a> terrain and the occasional dark place.
	Hack it to death instantly before its yucky goo can muck things up.
	Its goo eats through organic things like <a href="../Blurbs/CarvedClub.html">Carved Clubs</a>, <a href="../Blurbs/BlowPipe.html">Blow Pipes</a>, and <a href="../Blurbs/SquzskinGauntlets.html">Squzskin Gauntlets</a>.
	The Goo Snake is relatively rare. But not rare enough.
