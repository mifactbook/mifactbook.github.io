<p>
	Dented, dinged, and blemished, this <a href="../Items/Defensive.html">shield</a> once provided great protection for its wielder. As it is, it provides only <a href="../Items/Two.html">Armor Class 2</a> protection. Still, its nifty black color is bound to make you look evil. A visit to the <a href="../Locations/FarForge.html">Forger</a> will restore it to its original quality. You can carry only one.
