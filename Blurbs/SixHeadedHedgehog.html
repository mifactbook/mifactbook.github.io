<p>
	Possibly the most bizarre of the <a href="../Blurbs/LesserMutates.html">Lesser Mutates</a>, this beastie is a cross between a <a href="../Blurbs/GrizzlyHedgehog.html">Grizzly Hedgehog</a> and a <a href="../Blurbs/SixHeadedAdder.html">Six-headed Adder</a>.
	Each of its tiny, furry little heads is lined with rows of razor-sharp fangs, each one ready to take a bite out of you.
	Even chopping off a head or two barely slows it down.
	But be persistent, because if you let down your guard, eventually, one of the heads will manage to bite you but good.
