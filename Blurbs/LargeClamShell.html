	These are found right where they should be - in any terrain that's adjacent to the sea. They are useful for digging. You should be able to dig deep enough to make a Hidey-hole, but probably not enough to make a <a href="../Locations/DeepPit.html">Deep Pit</a>. You may carry three shells. A Large Clam Shell only lasts for one dig as it usually breaks when rocky soil is encountered. You will automatically discard your broken clam shell.
