<p>
	When you're looking for a spot to sit down in, take care that you don't rest near a Grabber Bush.
	Not actually a plant at all, this creature will try to grab you with its tentacles, which look like a bush's branches, and drive you onto its sharp thorns.
	After killing you, it will slowly digest your corpse. A sharp <a href="../Items/Edged.html">Edged</a> weapon is its nemesis.
	If you want to make sure you never meet another, stick to <a href="../Items/SandPalms.html">Sand & Palms</a> terrain; they're never found there.
