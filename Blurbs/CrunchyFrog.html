<p>
	One minute you're walking serenely through <a href="../Items/Swamp.html">swamp</a> terrain smelling the wild flowers, and the next minute POW! A slimy, black Crunchy Frog is leaping at your throat! This beast would be just an ordinary giant frog if it weren't for its short tail, claws and vicious temper.
	It's best just to drop your weapon and <a href="../Blurbs/Wrestling.html">grapple</a> with this critter, slime and all.
	But why crunchy? Apparently it's so full of small bones it's impossible to successfully emove them all before feasting on its carcass.
