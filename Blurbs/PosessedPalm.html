<p>
	You've seen palms sway in the breeze before and probably thought nothing of it.
	However there's no breeze at the moment and this palm is definitely swaying towards you.
	Also something seems strange about the nuts on this palm, almost as if they have been ground at one end to a sharp point to cause more damage when falling on a passing head.
	An <a href="../Items/Edged.html">Edged</a> weapon is your best bet for a quick dispatch.
	Killing one will allow you to get near enough to collect one or two of its riper <a href="../Blurbs/Coconut.html">coconuts</a>.
