<p>
	Almost monsterly smart (an oxymoron, we know), the Water Imp is clever, agile, mischevious, and more than just a little bit dangerous.
	Equipped with a powerful, almost serpentine body, short legs ending in sharp-clawed webbed feet, needle-sharp canine teeth, and a prehensile tail, this creature is at home in the water or on dry land near a good water source.
	Though generally friendly, if you anger it, it is more than willing to rip you to shreds and play with the pieces.
