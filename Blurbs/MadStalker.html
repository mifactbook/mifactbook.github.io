<p>
	This putrid nightmare would seem out of place on any island or continent.
	The Mad Stalker is 30 hands tall, with yellow and grey coloured rotting flesh. It reeks of death and decay.
	It has 6 heads (each with a sharp horn), 3 well-built arms, and several oddly shaped legs and other strange limbs.
	Unless you can really kick butt, or in this case prod butt with a decent pole weapon, you'd be better leaving this thing well alone.
	To avoid any future contact, stay out of <a href="../Items/Sticks.html">sticks</a> and <a href="../Items/Jungle.html">jungle</a> terrain.
