	<ul style="margin-left:15px;">
		<li>Battle consists of a Missile phase followed by up to two Close-in Fighting phases. After this, one side always retreats, ending the battle.</li>
		<li>Beginning Monsters cannot prevent the foe they're battling from successfully fleeing.</li>
		<li>After a battle with another Monster, if that Monster remains alive he'll hide himself well; you'll be unable to find him again that turn.</li>
		<li>Killing a Monster will get you as many of his possessions as you can carry. Killing (or Snatching) from a Monster new to the island isn't smart; he has little or no valuable items.</li>
		<li>The NO ATTACK order does not prevent you from fighting back. Nor does it stop an A or S order of yours from working.</li>
