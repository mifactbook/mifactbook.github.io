title: Zoingots
blurb: |
  <p>The Zoingo Mutants, or Zoingots as the more politically correct of monsters call them, are at first glance nothing like a race of monsters. Every one you meet is different in some bizarre way. However, avaraging out the number of limbs, heads, digits, eyes, etc.
  you can arrive at a set of features which the majority of the race share, namely two heads, four eyes, four arms, twenty-four fingers, two legs and twelve toes. They are (in the main) a hairless race. With so many spare limbs and eyes, they've become skilled craftsmen,
  especially in the area of jewellery. They are also excellent miners, producing a lot of silver and gold, some of which is made into their currency. Finally, they seem to have a natural empathy with some animals and so make great train drivers.</p>
