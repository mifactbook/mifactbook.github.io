<p>
	At times it would be nice to have a <a href="../Items/Bashing.html">Bashing</a> weapon to use against a particular Creature. If you search <a href="../Items/LowHills.html">Low Hills</a> terrain it is possible to find a fallen hardwood tree. Use your <a href="../Blurbs/Knife.html">Knife</a> and a branch from such a tree to fashion yourself a Carved Club. To do this use the MAKE order: M 4. This takes 24 Action Points. A Carved Club is <a href="../Items/Two.html">Damage Class 2</a> and you can carry just one.
