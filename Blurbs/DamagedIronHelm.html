<p>
	This <a href="../Blurbs/IronHelm.html">Iron Helm</a> has seen better days. A large rift in it has reduced its <a href="../Items/Helmets.html">Armour Class</a> protection to <a href="../Items/Two.html">Level 2</a>. A <a href="../Locations/FarForge.html">Forger</a> can repair it back to <a href="../Items/Three.html">Level 3</a> for a certain number of <a href="../Blurbs/Ocular.html">Oculars</a>. You can carry two.
