<p>
	Remember the good ol' days when a plant used to sit around and let you pluck leaves, coconuts, or various useful tools? Well, those days are over.
	It's time to meet the Two-Spot Skunkplant, the smelliest thing to hit Monster Island since the first wave of Ruks.
	This plant will never actually attack you with wave after wave of putrid stench.
	And worse of all, if you manage to give it sufficient time, it will squirt you with a nasty stream of very odiferous odor that will follow you for ages.
	Most monsters will find such an aroma to be repugnant.
