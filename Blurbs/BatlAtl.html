<p>
	Just what you wanted, a bat eight hands long and as big around as your thumb.
	This species lies in wait in small, deep holes in the walls of caves and at the right moment, comes whistling out at great velocity to spear their prey.
	They then consume them in small, dainty pieces.
	A flock of these bats can skewer you like a Ruk-Kebab as quick as a <a href="../Blurbs/RockTroll.html">Rock Troll</a> with a <a href="../Blurbs/TrollPike.html">Troll Pike</a>.
	When you hear the whistling in the dark, just be sure to duck.
