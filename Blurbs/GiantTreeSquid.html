<p>
	Watch out! Not all those vines you pass by in <a href="../Items/Jungle.html">Jungle</a> terrain are really vines - some of them are the long dark tentacles of the Giant Tree Squid.
	This arboreal menace lies in wait to grab the next passer by and make a meal of them.
	Its tentacles are very strong and will attempt to lift you up towards its snapping beak.
	You'd better have an <a href="../Items/Edged.html">edged</a> weapon ready, or else!
