	If you ever thought the <a href="../Blurbs/OrbOfSeeing.html">Orb of Seeing</a> was too limited then here is the item for you. CRYSTAL BALLS were manufactured in the labyrinths of the Netherworld during the Second Demigod War. Using arcane magics of a kind not seen in aeons, this device allows you to see all kinds of things within four squares of your current location. To use it, just USE it. Also don't lose it because the Wizards will not allow you to replace it since they are so rare. You can carry but one of these.
