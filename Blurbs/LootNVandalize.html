		Let's say you have come across a building, temple, or whatever. You aren't in the best of moods and decide to loot the structure for anything useful. While you are at it you decide that you may as well vandalize it too. To do this you can issue the LOOT 'n VANDALIZE order: LV.
		This uses 16 Action Points. Hope you know what you're doing! This order can be <em>very dangerous</em> to issue. Take care and don't become a DLV (Died while Looting 'n Vandalizing).
