<p>
	A distant relative of the <a href="../Blurbs/GreatWhiteStork.html">Great White Stork</a>, the Snatcherbird is a long-legged feathered fiend that just can't help trying to feather its nest with your hide.
	And if it can't get your hide, at least it will come away with an item or two to use instead.
	Be sure to kill this creature as quickly as possible, otherwize it will, and weemphasise WILL, leave you with slightly less than you originally had.
