	What flies through the dark dropping small combustive droppings on your head? If it's not the Blue Bird of Paradise it must be the one and only Flack Bat.
	Maybe it's not the most effective mode of battle and maybe it'll just try to bite you instead but still you've got to admit that explosive poop has long been a dream of yours.
