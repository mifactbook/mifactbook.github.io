<p>
	There's nothing like a little fire to get a battle moving and this little elixir is just the fire starter. To make it, you have to mix two <a href="../Blurbs/WhiteLotusElixir.html">White Lotus Elixirs</a> with two <a href="../Blurbs/FireDust.html">Fire Dusts</a> in your <a href="../Blurbs/VoodooCauldron.html">Voodoo Cauldron</a> for 18 Action Points. The resulting mixture can be equipped as a <a href="../Items/Two.html">Class 2</a> <a href="../Items/Missile.html">Missile</a> weapon, Of course, it'll ignite on contact and start a fire right on your opponent. You'll then be the life of the party. You can carry up to six of these.
