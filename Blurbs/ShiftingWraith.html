<p>
	Upon meeting up with this undead apparition, you may finally gain some respect for the island's Undead.
	It's very fast (as if can jump/shift from place to place) and sometimes very deadly, making it a foe you hope to survive an encounter with, rather than one you hope to kill.
	If you're equipped with Silver or Magic weaponry, you'll at least have a chance of hurting it.
	Its diseased-looking, smelly, crumbling flesh is not something you'll ever want to come in contact with.
