<p>
	These eggs from a <a href="../Blurbs/Nitrohen.html">Nitrohen</a> are explosive and can be lobbed into battle when equipped as your <a href="../Items/Missile.html">missile</a> weapon. However, be careful as they are very unstable. It would probably be a bad idea to fall down a pit when carrying them, you might end up with egg on your face! You can carry up to 6, any more and you'd be likely to drop one. BOOM!
