	<p>Spawned by some horrible experiment of nature or monster (you can't tell which), the Lesser Mutates are horribly mutated creatures with seemingly random parts attached. And all the parts are made for killing! The Lesser varieties of Mutates consist of a variety of horrors that will keep you hacking and slashing...and wondering where they came from.</p>
