<p>
	Made of a fine grade of iron, this sturdy <a href="../Items/Helmets.html">helm</a> has been damaged in battle and is in need of repair. Its dark blue finish is quite fetching and is the rage with those enjoying battle under the deep blue sky. In its current state, it provides <a href="../Items/Two.html">Armor Class 2</a> protection. You can carry two of them.
