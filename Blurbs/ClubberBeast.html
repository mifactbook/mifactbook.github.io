<p>
	Another of the <a href="../Blurbs/LesserMutates.html">Leser Mutates</a>, the Clubberbeast is a cross between a <a href="../Blurbs/Tholomite.html">Tholomite</a> and a <a href="../Blurbs/MandibularCrab.html">Mandibular Crab</a>.
	It will usually spring from a body of water and attempt to bash you to pieces with its large, oversized claw. Best to fight back quickly unless you are a fan of king-sizes headaches.
