<div class="info-section">
	<h2>Group Leadership</h2>
	<p>Your group has the ability to appoint a leader by democratic means. You may issue the GL (Monster#) order, selecting which monster you would like to lead the group. If, at any time, over half of the members have selected the same monster, then that monster is declared the group leader. The leader of a group may issue the GL 0 order which supplies the contact names and addresses of all members.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
	<h2>Changing Groups</h2>
	<p>If you're a member of a Group and you no longer wish to be, Kowtow at your God's altar stone for exactly 113 Action Points. This is the first of two steps needed to change groups; the second being initiated by a member of the group you wish to join. The penalties for performing this Kowtow are significant - expect to be very weak afterwards. (if you don't follow a God, Kowtow at any God's altar stone.)</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
	<h2>Group Caches</h2>
	<p>From now on, when you do a RID order, you will attempt a add to or create a cache that only your Group can locate. When you enter a square having a cache created by your group, you'll automatically find it and receive a list of its contents. To take things from a cache, use the GET FROM CACHE order: G (Item#) (Qty). To automatically take everything from each cache you discover, issue the GLEAN CACHE order: GC. It's a standing order - issue it again to cancel it. A cache will only be created if a choice spot is found (otherwise the RID is cancelled). A group may have just one cache in a square. A cache can contain only 9 different items, but there's no limit on the quantity of these items. Once the cache is empty it no longer exists.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
	<h2>Group Cache Notes</h2>
	<p>
		<ul style="margin-left:15px;">
			<li>Caches can't exist in inappropriate terrains (such as <a href="../Items/Sea.html">Sea</a> or <a href="../Items/HighJungle.html">High Jungle</a>)</li>
			<li>Should you kill (or find dead) a Monster possessing more items than you can carry, such items aren't place into a cash</li>
			<li>Food cannot be placed in a cache.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
	<h2>Group Item Transfer</h2>
	<p>As a member of a Group, you have a special ability with regard to XFER orders. When an XFER order is attempted with another member of your Group, and that member isn't in the square you occupy, the XFER is remembered and the item transfer will be attempted if you encounter that member within the next 24 days. Up to four of these delayed XFER orders will be remembered.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
	<h2>Group Mapping</h2>
	<p>To facilitate map swapping amongst a Group, you can now recenter your map on a fellow Group member's map origin. Issue the ORIGIN ON MONSTER order: 0 (Monster#). No Action Points are used.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
	<h2>Totem Markings</h2>
	<p>Some Groups seek to take over a portion of the island and make it their own territory. Rather than put up NO TRESPASSING signs, the group marks certain trees in each square with its totems. This informs a stranger that he's in a place where he is not welcome. To erect Totem Marks in a square takes 20 Action Points. If a square already contains Totem Marks it takes another 10 Action Points to erase what's there. To claim control of a square for your group, issue the TOTEM MARKING order: TM. You'll need a <a href="../Blurbs/Knife.html">knife</a> to do the actual carving/marking.</p>
