	<p>
		This ancient Spell was created to control and contain the forces of <a href="../Items/Shroud.html">Shroud</a>. The first followers of Shroud found great utility in the <a href="../Blurbs/Lightning.html">Lightning</a> Spell.
		Its power in battle was devastating. The Reflect spell was developed as a counter to this menace. Most are surprised to learn that the Reflect spell was developed by followers of Shround as a protection from attacks by fellow followers.
		Shroud allowed the spell to be created to keep his followers from destroying each other. Reflect creates a mirror-like surface in front of the caster that can actually bounce normal lightning back at its summoner.
		To cast this defensive spell in battle, issue the Cast Spell order: C 877. It uses 30 Spell Points each time it is cast.
