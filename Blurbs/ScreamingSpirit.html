<p>
	Got a head-ache that won't go away? Maybe suffering from a loss of hearing? Maybe you've met this pitiful member of the <a href="../Blurbs/EtherealUndead.html">Ethereal Undead</a> - the Screaming Spirit.
	It represents the torn spirit of a female Ruk whose life ended in tragedy and pain.
	These spirits are often captured by those with evil intentions and used to ward off the curious from places of great importance.
	If you see one, forget your weapon since it will do no good. Special magic is what you need to overcome this wretched creature.
