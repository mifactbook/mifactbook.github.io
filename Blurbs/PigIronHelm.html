<p>
	This enormous hunk of obsidian black <a href="../Blurbs/IngotOfPigIron.html">PigIron</a> is really a crudely hammered PigIron <a href="../Items/Helmets.html">Helm</a>. But don't let its crudity fool you. It makes an excellent helm to wear in battle...as long as you are able to support its enormous size. The problem is that this was made to fit a <a href="../Blurbs/RockTroll.html">Troll</a>, a group of races with head sizes that match the egos of even the most boastful Ruks. If you find one of these helms, you have only a small chance that it will be small enough to fit your head. If it does, it will provide you with <a href="../Items/Five.html">Level 5 Protection</a> for your head. You can carry two but you must have a muscle of at least 350 to equip one.
