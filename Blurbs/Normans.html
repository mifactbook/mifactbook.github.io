title: Normans
blurb: |
  <p>Normans are distinguished by their red hair. They love to work out and be physically fit. They gain the most
  from exercising and want to be fantastic athletes. Their weakness is that some Creatures are more likely to attack
  them than run away because they look tasty. The Normans are the tallest race and tend to be the most skilled at
  battle. They're the least likely to be affected by a poison.</p>
