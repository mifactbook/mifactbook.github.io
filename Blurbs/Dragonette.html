<p>
	This insectoid is nine hands-long worth of flying devil capable of snatching a <a href="../Blurbs/BlackPackRowt.html">Black Pack Rowt</a> from a rock and eating it in two bites.
	It comes equipped with rattling wings, a double pair of razor-sharp mandibles and a dagger-like abdomen just waiting to plunge itself into you and to even lay a few eggs to consume your dead body.
	Sheesh. This is one unfriendly bug. Top it off with a set of bug eyes that give it almost perfect vision and you've got a foe that is real trouble.
