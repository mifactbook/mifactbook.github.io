<p>
	Long-dead warriors for <a href="../Items/VladosXi.html">Vlados Xi</a>, Ghasts retain an inkling of what it was like to be living.
	This causes them to be much more cunning fighters than the more common <a href="../Blurbs/Ghoul.html">Ghouls</a>.
	They also have a more burning hatred of the living as they envy them for all they have lost.
	Avoid the spindly arms and legs unless you want the <a href="../Blurbs/Voodoo.html">voodoo</a> enhanced nails to rip your flesh from the bone.
	And stay away from its bone-cracking teeth unless you want to become the main course at the local Banquet of the Undead.
