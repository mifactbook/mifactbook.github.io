<p>
	The Death Knight is a perfect killing machine.
	Created by only the most skilled and talented of Mages, the spell to create one takes months of finely crafted incantations and only the finest of Black <a href="../Blurbs/Voodoo.html">Voodoo</a> ingredients.
	Equip it with a <a href="../Blurbs/BlackIronShield.html">Black Iron Shield</a> and it can take a serious pounding before giving up the ghost.
	But as soon as you turn your back, it is back together and taking more hacks at you with its rusty blade.
	Avoid Death Knights if you want to live a long and healthy life. Otherwise you may end up as a pile of bones yourself.
