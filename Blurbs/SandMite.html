<p>
	One of those infuriating little creatures whose sole purpose is to annoy the heck out of you, the Sand Mite is not too tough but it sure can get under your skin with its little claws and scratchy feet.
	Stay out of <a href="../Items/SandPalms.html">Sand and Palms</a> terrain if you want to avoid the irritation.
