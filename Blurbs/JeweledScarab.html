	About the size of the palm of your hand, this beautiful piece of jewelry is made in the shape of a large beetle. It is made of solid gold and is covered with small gemstones encrusting what would be its shell. You figure something like this has got to be worth some money though you would never be caught dead wearing one. You can carry as many as 40.
