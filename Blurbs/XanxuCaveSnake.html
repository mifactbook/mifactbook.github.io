<p>
	Weapons are useless against this nasty creation of Xanxu. You see, it attacks by slithering up your body.
	You have to be quick enough to realize what's happening and keep its forked-tongue away from your throat.
	It becomes a <a href="../Blurbs/Wrestling.html">wrestling</a> match.
	If you're muscular and have been eating well and drinking good water, you should have the stamina to defeat this snake.
	On the other hand, if you're quite hungry and last drank foul water, you're in deep trouble.
