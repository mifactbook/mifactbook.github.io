<p>
	Not really a <a href="../Blurbs/Dragon.html">dragon</a> and not really a snake, the Dragonsnake seems to be a crazy combination of snake and dragon that neither <a href="../Items/Yasmin.html">Yasmin El Boa</a> or <a href="../Items/Kadar.html">Kadar the Black</a> would appreciate.
	Its sinuous body is equipped with hardened scales and it can breath fire if you get close.
	This creature is rather rare since both followers of Yasmin El Boa and Kadar the Back seem to go out of their way to kill them.
