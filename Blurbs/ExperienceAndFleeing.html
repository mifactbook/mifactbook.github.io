		The first time you hit in battle or practice with a weapon of a new Weapon Class, you attain Skill Level 1 in this Weapon Class. Successive hits and practicing will eventually increase your Skill Levels. A second type of battle experience is Total Creatures Killed and Total Monsters Battled.
		Over time, this will make you a smarter, swifter fighter, enabling you to hit more often. Fleeing in battle due to damage incurred is determined by comparing your new Healthiness to your Riskiness. Riskiness 9 will have you flee when your Healthiness falls to 30%, 8 is 40%, 7 is 50%, and 6 is 60%.
