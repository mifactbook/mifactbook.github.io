<p>
	If you've ever heard a real rattle snake then multiply the sound by threefold and that's what you got here.
	Both annoying and numbing after awhile, they are best dealt with promptly.
	Caving in its head with a <a href="../Items/Bashing.html">Bashing</a> weapon seems a likely course of action.
	Its carcass is of no value, but it would make for a nice surprise as the Creature in a Trapped Pit.
	It seems to prefer <a href="../Items/Sticks.html">Sticks</a> and <a href="../Items/SandPalms.html">Sand & Palms</a> terrain.
