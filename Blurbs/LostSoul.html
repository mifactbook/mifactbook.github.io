<p>
	One of the Ethereral Undead, the Lost Soul is the spirit of a deceased monster that has gotten lost, through mishap or magic, on its way to its final resting place.
	Its ghostly howl and chilling touch can bring fear to the hearts of even the most stallwart of monsters.
	To kill one, you need a special weapon as normal weapons will do no harm to its incorporeal form.
	If you meet one of these creatures in a dark place, be sure to leave yourself a clear path to the exit.
	They have a nasty tendency to close and lock doors behind curious monsters.
