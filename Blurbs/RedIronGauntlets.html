	The perfect gift for those who give the gift of killing. Red Iron Gauntlets make a Ruk's hands appear to be dipped in blood. Real battle gore just seems to help them shine. As a bonus, they even provide <a href="../Items/Three.html">Armour Class 3</a> protection to your <a href="../Items/Gauntlets.html">hands</a>. You can carry only one pair.
