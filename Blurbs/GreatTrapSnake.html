<p>
	As you might gather from the name, this snake is big. But what's really big about it is its mouth. It can eat most anything whole.
	Although it is not impossible to kill, it sure seems like it.
	And, if you find yourself in a <a href="../Locations/DeepPit.html">Deep Pit</a> with one, your life could well be over! If you somehow kill one, you will have a ton of meat on your hands.
	Very tasty food! This snake is commonly found in <a href="../Items/LowHills.html">hilly</a> terrain.
	A <a href="../Blurbs/SpikedClub.html">Spiked Club</a> is a great weapon for fighting one of these frightening creatures.
	The Great Trap Snake has never been heard making a sound, except for the loud 'Gulp' as it swallows you.
