<p>
	This solid Silver necklace gleams resplendently. The double farn eagle engraving gives you the impression that this amulet is quite valuable. When equipped, this amulet provides some protection against certain dangerous foes. Like all Silver items, should a Ghost approach you when you're equipped with it, he'll sustain a loss of a Spirit Pt or two. You can carry any number but can only be equipped with one Amulet.
