<p>
	Wouldn't you know that <a href="../Blurbs/Roaches.html">roaches</a> would be immune to devastation. The Armored Roach may not be the biggest of the roaches, but it may be the toughest to kill.
	You're going to have to pound, slash, poke, or snap a lot to finish off this creature. If you are not quick enough, it may just finish off you instead.
