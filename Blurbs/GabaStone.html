<p>
	A common possession of the <a href="../Blurbs/Knolltir.html">Knolltir</a>, these small, egg-shaped, shiny black stones are rumored to be of great power. They're supposed to protect the bearer from all sorts of things - injuries, disease, even bad luck...about the only way Knolltir discover Gaba Stones is to accidentally lie on them in a Hillock. (With such little light inside a Hillock, they're impossible to see.) Because the Knolltir are the only race who can stand to live and sleep in a Hillock, they're the only source of these stones. The Knolltir consider these stones to be very lucky. You can carry 60.
