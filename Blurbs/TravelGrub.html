	This is a special dried food that is made at <a href="../Locations/FarInn.html">Far Inns</a> for purchase by adventuring travelers. It seems to keep indefinitely. One Travel Grub is automatically consumed whenever you get hungry and have no other food. Travel Grub has the equivalent nourishment and filling value of two meals. You can carry 12.
