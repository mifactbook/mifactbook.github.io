<p>
	The Dungdrop Beetle is the ugly little creature that keeps the island clean from the scattered droppings of big beasts like the <a href="../Blurbs/Tusker.html">Tusker</a> or the <a href="../Blurbs/Walraphant.html">Walraphant</a>.
	It gathers drops of doo and lines its modest-sized den with the material.
	In cases where the droppings are few and far between, the Dungdrop Beetle will not hesitate to look for "undigested" prey, including the occasional Ruk.
	Given its armored exoskeleton, it can take a lot of damage and its strong jaws can easily sever an important limb or two.
	Best to watch your step when in the territory of one of these beetles.
