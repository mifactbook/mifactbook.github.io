<p>
	Eeeeeeewwwwww. This is one nasty, nasty, nasty, smelly, smelly, smelly creature.
	It might have once been a regular old <a href="../Blurbs/Cheesmo.html">Cheesmo</a> of some type (there's a lot of types of Cheesmos on the island...did you know that?) but its been horrible afflicted by some aweful disease and now sits there bloating and smelling and being all around miserable.
	Of course, that can make it a pretty yucky customer to deal with.
