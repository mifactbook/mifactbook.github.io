	Wap! There's nothing like seeing the face of your opponent immediately after a well hurled Mud pie has connected. Only intelligent Mudwalkers during an <a href="../Blurbs/AncestralCeremonies.html">Ancestral Ceremony</a> can acquire this ability to Make and hurl these muddy <a href="../Items/Missile.html">missiles</a>. Other races cannot even equip with a Mudpie. Anytime you're travelling in <a href="../Items/LowHills.html">Low Hills</a> terrain and you've less than 9 Mudpies, you'll Make more and at no cost in Action Points. You can carry 9.
