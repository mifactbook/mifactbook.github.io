<p>
	This gigantic, bloated, pink, stubby-legged beast is a bizzarity that could only happen on Monster Island.
	Its head ends in a huge prehensile trunk that is long enough and strong enough to wrap around your neck, pick you up and use you to pound hills flat.
	Add a pair of massive ivory tusks and this creature is a handful for most any Ruk.
