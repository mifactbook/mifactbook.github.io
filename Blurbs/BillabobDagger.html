<p>
	The <a href="../Blurbs/Billabob.html">Billabob</a> is an extremely effective hunter that uses its finely serated beak to skewer its pret. You can use the same approach to skewering your foes. Just take one <a href="../Blurbs/BillabobBill.html">Billabob Bill</a> and secure it to a well-shaped stick using one <a href="../Blurbs/ToadLeather.html">Toad Leather</a> and your <a href="../Blurbs/Knife.html">Knife</a>. The resultant double-bladed dagger has the double-penetrating action you need to take down your foe. The Billabob Dagger does <a href="../Items/Three.html">Class Three</a> Damage and you can carry two. It will take 40 Action Points to make one.
