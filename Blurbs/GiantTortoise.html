<p>
	These large creatures are found along the <a href="../Items/Sea.html">shore</a> or in larger pools of water inland. They are only dangerous if you attack them or if they discover you in a <a href="../Locations/HideyHole.html">Hidey-Hole</a>. They are nearly impossible to kill through their hardened shell. The only vulnerable spot on their body is a tiny soft area in the centre of their forehead. A <a href="../Items/Pole.html">spear</a> is very useful in attacking the tortoise from a distance while you probe for this spot.
