<p>
	Stepping lightly on some loose leaves and twigs, it suddenly rises before you in a fit of anger.
	The largest member of the bear family, the Mangy Beast appears to have spent the last few months hibernating here.
	Its size and disheveled appearance are nothing compared to its ugly disposition. It can rise to over 20 hands in height.
	Nature has provided the beast with one of the hardest heads on the island and it likes nothing better than to rise to its full height and dive forward in a devastating head butt.
	Watch where you step when traveling in Hills terrain.
