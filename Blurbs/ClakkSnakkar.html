<p>
	The Clakk Snakkars are quite interesting and somewhat friendly. About 7 hands tall, they resemble miniature elves. The kind that fight with Knives.
	They're almost intelligent enough to be classified as a Race, but not quite.
	However, they're smart enough to flee when facing a superior foe and incredibly adept at getting away.
	Their skin is of the leather-rubbery sort, pale-yellow in color, and is shed quite often.
