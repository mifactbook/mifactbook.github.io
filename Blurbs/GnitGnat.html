<p>
	These are quite annoying! They are large, sturdy bugs found most often in <a href="../Items/LowHills.html">Low Hills</a>.
	If they decide they like you, they will follow you forever.
	Although the swarm will always be nearby, only one of them attacks at a time, usually just after you finish hunting and select a final campsite for the week.
	It's tricky to be rid of them. Each attacks with its nasty stinger.
