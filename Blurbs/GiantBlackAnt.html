<p>
	Ants.... No big deal right... Little bugs you squish for entertainment. If you have gone without food for a while, you even use them for a snack.
	Now this Ant will make a meal of you. Over 4 hands long (half of which are those wicked pinchers), this bubba is not likely to be on your menu.
	Giant Black Ants are found only in <a href="../Items/HighJungle.html">High Jungle</a> or its remains. They live in middle canopy levels.
	They are best avoided, but should you need to fight one, a <a href="../Items/Pole.html">Pole</a> Class weapon is best.
	You may be to penetrate the joints in the Ants armor. If nothing else, it keeps the darn thing at a distance.
