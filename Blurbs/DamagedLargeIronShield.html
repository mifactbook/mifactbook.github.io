<p>
	New, this is a heck of a shield. Even damaged, this <a href="../Items/Defensive.html">Defensive</a> Weapon provides <a href="../Items/Three.html">Armor Class 3</a> protection. Have it repaired by a <a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html">Jossman</a> <a href="../Locations/FarForge.html">Forger</a>. It is equippable only by Monsters who have a Muscle of 140+. You can carry 1.
