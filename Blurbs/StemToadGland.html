<p>
	If you capture one <a href="../Blurbs/StemToad.html">Stem Toad</a> you can issue the MAKE order: M 150. This takes 5 Action Points and you'll need a <a href="../Blurbs/Knife.html">Knife</a> to remove its special gland. You may carry 4 of these glands. Special note: You cannot acquire the gland by first killing a Stemtoad - you need to extract it from a live one.
