<p>
	This neotenic species is the only bat to breathe solely by the use of external gills growing from its thin-skinned wings. Its body is covered with the most beautiful black and yellow colouration making it one of the loveliest creatures you're ever going to have to kill.
	Be warned, though, its soft fleashy appearance hides a bad disposition and a mean set of razor-plated jaws capable of biting off an arm or head. And you'd be in real trouble with just one arm.
