<p>
	Now this is some serious armour. Made from individual rings of PigIron and underlain by a supple leather, this armour is extremely large and extremely heavy. Since it is made for <a href="../Blurbs/RockTroll.html">Trolls</a>, it will seldom be small enough to fit a Ruk. If you are lucky enough to get one it takes no less than 850 muscle to carry its enormous weight. If you are lucky enough to come into posession of a suit of this armour, keep in mind you can only carry one. It provides <a href="../Items/Body.html">Body</a> <a href="../Items/Five.html">Armour Level 5</a> protection.
