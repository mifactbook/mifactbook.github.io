<p>
	This occasionally useful item is made by any competent Forger. Although Silver Knuckles are not equipped per se, they're automatically used whenever you're <a href="../Blurbs/Wrestling.html">Wrestling</a> someone or something. It can increase damage by 50% at times, or up to 200% vs. foes particularly susceptible to silver weaponry. Silver Knuckles are the <a href="../Blurbs/BloodMummy.html">Blood Mummy's</a> bane. You gain a slight additional benefit from having two instead of just one. You can carry 5.
