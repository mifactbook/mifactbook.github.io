<p>
	Gourds, don't 'cha just love 'em? These are bright red and orange, and about the size of your fist. They make for, well, nothing. They're cool to look at, though. You'll automatically pick some when you come across 'em (most often in Jungle terrain). As you don't want to carry 'em around forever, you'll make them a gift to the <a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html">Jossmen</a> at the next Far structure you come to. Jossmen think they're super cool. You can carry 5.
