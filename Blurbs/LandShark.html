<p>
	These rare but super-dangerous creatures are found only in <a href="../Items/Sticks.html">Sticks</a> and <a href="../Items/Swamp.html">Swampy</a> terrain.
	Picture a Mako shark with suckers instead of fins.
	Rather than tearing you limb from limb its jaws only serve to hold you securely so its suckers can attach to your body and drain you of every ounce of bodily fluid.
	It then spits out your dehydrated carcass and continues hunting. Killing a Landshark takes an incredible amount of Wrestling skill.
	The Landshark is the only creature with its own theme music - dum, dum...dum, dum...dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum.
