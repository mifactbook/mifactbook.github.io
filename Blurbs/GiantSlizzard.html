<p>
	When skulking through a <a href="../Items/Swamp.html">swamp</a>, watch where you step.
	Too often a Monster will step on a log to cross a patch of wetlands and find himself standing on the back of a Giant Slizzard.
	It does not take well to being trod upon and has the perfect solution - eat the offender! In fact, eating is one of its favourite pastimes.
	Its large jaws can accommodate even the largest of Monsters. Its teeth can chew you up in just a few bites.
	Stabbing it with a <a href="../Items/Pole.html">Pole</a> weapon seems to mae the most sense, as it lets you keep a bit of distance from its dripping teeth.
