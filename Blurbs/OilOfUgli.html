<p>
	A favorite elixir of Trolls of all races, Oil of Ugli', when applied to the skin, will result in a preponderance of sores, welts, and lesions. To make an Oil, combine 1 <a href="../Blurbs/SomandaDust.html">Somanda Dust</a>, 1 <a href="../Blurbs/GuanoPlasm.html">Guano Plasm</a> and 1 <a href="../Blurbs/Oil.html">oil</a> in a <a href="../Blurbs/VoodooCauldron.html">voodoo cauldron</a> and stew for 18 Action Points. To use it, issue the U 461 Order and you will smear it all over your face. The results are quite exceptional if you are a Troll. You can carry 6 of these.
