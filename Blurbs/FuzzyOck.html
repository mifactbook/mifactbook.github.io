<p>
	Cute! Adorable!! Loveable!!! Harmless!!!! In fact killing one serves no purpose other than cruelty.
	The small 2 finger high Ock could not threaten anything except the mushrooms that they eat.
	Fuzzy Ocks can be found almost anywhere fungus grows and light is scarce.
	The Ock is normally found sitting quietly on a small mushroom, eating peacefully. Only a beast or a butcher would harm a helpless Ock.
