<p>
	Thin as the blade of a <a href="../Blurbs/LongSword.html">Long Sword</a>, this bat lies snuggly on most any ledge in some of the smellier caves of Monster Island.
	Some might call it lazy; other accuse it of sloth.
	You though are about to find out that it is the perfecty adapted fighting machine about to bite your head off.
	Your best bet is to use a Level 5 Bellows from your local <a href="../Locations/FarForge.html">Forge</a> to blow it away.
	If you've not worked on your hot air blowing ability enough, though, maybe you will have better luck with some other weapon.
