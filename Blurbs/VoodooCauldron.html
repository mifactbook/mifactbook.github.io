<p>
	A Voodoo Cauldron is the main tool of any <a href="../Blurbs/Voodoo.html">Voodoo</a> practitioner. It is possessed of special properties. When certain ingredients are combined within a Cauldron some wonderful (or deadly!) results can occur. Take away a Voodoo Master's Cauldron and you have stripped him of his ability to produce new Voodoo potions and elixirs. Possessing a Voodoo Cauldron does you no good without the proper ingredients and Knowledge of Voodoo. Cauldrons are small, blackened, metal pots which are easily carried by any Monster. You can carry one.
