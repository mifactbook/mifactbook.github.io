		<p>
			You either hid, attempted to avoid, or simply fled from an encounter with a Creature. This occurred because your Riskiness level is too low (for this particular Creature), because you decided this Creature
			was too tough, or the Creature was a friendlier one and your Friendliness level was too high for a battle to occur. If you wish another shot at the Creature, set your Riskiness higher (and/or Friendliness lower)
			and return to the same square. If you flee again you know this Creature is one you have no hope of defeating at present. You can be grateful you're smart enough to scram rather than having your brains bashed in or torn to itty-bitty pieces.
