<p>
	This large, jet-black Ring is a favourite of the <a href="../Items/HighJungle.html">High Jungle</a> dwelling <a href="../Blurbs/Bodden.html">Bodden</a>. It's actually a three-hole ring (like brass Knuckles) that's crafted from a Bone known only to the Bodden. This ring protects the Bodden in some secret, magic way, and can only be equipped by a Bodden. You can carry 100.
