<p>
	This flying insect doesn't buzz like its smaller cousin the <a href="../Blurbs/BludgeonBee.html">Bludgeon Bee</a>, but makes an irritating whining noise.
	It is always on the move, probably on the lookout for the best site to build its hive.
	Luckily few ever find a site worthy of them, so they are a rare species.
	It attacks with its dart-like stinger, and is fairly hard to hit well because it moves around so quickly.
	If you do hit one with a <a href="../Items/Bashing.html">Bashing</a> weapon it makes a very satisfying "Splat!" sound.
