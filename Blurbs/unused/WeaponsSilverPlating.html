        <h2>Weapons - Silver Plating</h2>
        <p>Weapons made from creature parts are are basic to every monster's inventory. They are the mark of creativity and pride. They also tend to be rather unreliable. No matter how skillful the Monster, pieces of dead things tend to break. If only you could make them tougher and add a little to their punch. Count on the <a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html">Jossmen</a> to make you wishes come true and take your coins. The Forgemaster explains that he can place a thin coat of Silver on some weapons to enhance them. He charges 50 Oculars for the Silver and you must pump the bellows (50 APs). Issue a Make Order - M Item#. (Note: You must be at a Forge with the Item you wish to Silver-Plate.)</p>
