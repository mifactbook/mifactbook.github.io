	Yes, the Undead walk on Monster Island! Few know the secret to their existence but most believe that skilled <a href="../Blurbs/Voodoo.html">Voodoo</a> practitioners have power over them.
	A Zombie is very difficult to eradicate.
	It never uses any sophisticated weaponry but rather relies on its teeth and superior strength to rip you from limb to limb.
	An <a href="../Items/Edged.html">Edged</a> weapon might be effective against it.
