<p>
	Possibly not the most essential of items you've ever invented, but one of the most ingenious, is the parachute. To manufacture one issue the MAKE order: M 252. This will take 30 Action Points. Take 4 <a href="../Blurbs/CrobblerSkin.html">Crobbler Skins</a>, slice them length-ways with a <a href="../Items/Knife.html">knife</a> to make 16 strands, then weave the strands together to make a big sheet. Next take 4 <a href="../Blurbs/WaxedOoze.html">Waxed Ooze</a> and spread them over the sheet to make it air-tight. Should you find yourself plummeting from a great height, you will automatically hold aloft your parachute to slow your descent. You may only carry one at a time.
