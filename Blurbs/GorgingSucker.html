<p>
	Buzzzzzzzzzz. Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sluuuuurrrrpp. If you hear this sound, know that you are now the main course at the Gorging Sucker picnic.
	With a proboscis over two hands long, this winged bug is not only a nuisance, it's dangerous.
	Heck, it could pierce your heart, liver, or brain (though that would probably kill it).
	Use a good <a href="../Items/Bashing.html">bashing</a> weapon to smash it flat. Squish.
