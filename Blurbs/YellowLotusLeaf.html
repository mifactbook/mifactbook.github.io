<p>
	This large, brilliant yellow leaf is fairly rare. Single leaves are usually found in the shade of a bush or tree. Its sweet, minty scent might mean it is worth saving. You'll harvest these leaves only when some have gone from spotted-yellow to all-yellow. There's no limit to the number you can carry.
