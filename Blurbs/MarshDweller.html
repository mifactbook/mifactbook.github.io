<p>
	Often hidden in stinky swamps and marshes is this very unfriendly Creature. It launches tendrils that resemble a chain and grappling hook.
	These snag you and slowly retract, carrying you toward its very large mouth. We're talking about a mouth that's almost bigger than the Creature.
	It's obvious it can eat most things whole, including you. A <a href="../Items/Pole.html">Pole</a> Weapon might be most practical against it.
