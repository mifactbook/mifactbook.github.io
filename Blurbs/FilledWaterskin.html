<p>
	This is a <a href="../Blurbs/Waterskin.html">waterskin</a> filled with water. Whenever you're at a location having a good water source (such as a <a href="../Locations/FarInn.html">Far Inn</a> or clear reflecting <a href="../Locations/Waterhole.html">Waterhole</a>) you'll fill up to two skins - so that you're carrying two filled ones. If during Make Camp you are very thirsty, you'll automatically drink a filled waterskin. You can carry 2.
