<p>
	Black with gray spotting, this 4 to 5 hand long spider goes an incredible distance by jumping. Its fangs are more of a nuisance than a major threat.
	Usually, Spring Spiders are found in <a href="../Items/LowHills.html">Low hills</a> and a <a href="../Items/Bashing.html">Bashing</a> weapon seems to be the right weapon.
