<p>
	You'd expect a worm to be slimey, stupid and gross kinda like a Ruk. But not the Plated Worm.
	This worm comes complete with heavy chitinous plates to protect its soft flesh. It also has an enormous mouth lined with long sharp teeth.
	It is more than smart enough to use its teeth and armour to make worm-mulch out of you.
