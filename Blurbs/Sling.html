	Littering most squares are animal carcasses. Besides contributing a foul stench to the air, these cadavers are picked over by the island's many scavengers. You notice one of these cadavers nearby and poke at it with a stick. The idea occurs to you that if you could find a larger one you could make a Sling from its hide.
