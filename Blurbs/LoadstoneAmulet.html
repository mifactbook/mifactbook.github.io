<p>
	Normans who are exercising maniacs find this magical <a href="../Items/Amulets.html">Amulet</a> quite beneficial. If the Norman wearing this very attractive looking Amulet Jazzercises at least once uring his turn, in Make Camp he'll regain up to 8 Health. Health is only regained if his ending Health is lower than his starting health for the Turn. Only a Norman knows how to use this Amulet properly - other races cannot even equip it. You can carry 2.
