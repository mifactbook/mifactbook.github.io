<p>
	This is a heavy wide-bladed sword that was obviously designed for war. Its dead weight and wide shape were not designed for elegant swordplay. This is a weapon strong warriors used to beat down their enemies defenses. The added weight of the Broadsword requires a Muscle of 125 to equip. It is a <a href="../Items/Four.html">Damage Class 4</a> <a href="../Items/Edged.html">Edged</a> Weapon. You can carry one.
