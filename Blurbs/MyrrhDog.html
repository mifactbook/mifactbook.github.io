<p>
	Now why would anyone want to cross a harmless <a href="../Blurbs/MyrrhDove.html">Myrrh Dove</a> with a smelly, foul-tempered <a href="../Blurbs/Hilldog.html">Hilldog</a>? Well, somebody did and you are going to have to pay for it.
	This monstrosity looks like a winged dog, but it has neither hair nor feathers. Its bare flesh is leathery and gross.
	Its wing tips are razor sharp and can slice you to pieces if you do not kill it quick.
	Oh, did we forget to mention its teeth? We're guessing you have already become familiar with them.
