<p>
	You want big? You want mean? You want nasty? You want to ruin your day? Well... here's your beastie.
	The Devastation Beast has got the temperament of a truckload of angry bees, mixed with a boatload of upset <a href="../Blurbs/Rockadile.html">Rockadiles</a>, mixed with a train load of <a href="../Blurbs/EnragedFungusBeast.html">Enraged Fungus Beasts</a>, and that's on a good day.
	This creature's so mean that it only lives in areas where stupid people have done stupid things and its out to show the island that its gonna make things worse.
	Oh, yeah, did we mention its BIG.
