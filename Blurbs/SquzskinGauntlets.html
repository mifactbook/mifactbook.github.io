	Yes, you need two <a href="../Blurbs/Squzskin.html">Squzskins</a> and 60 Action Points. Write a MAKE order: M 9. Of course you'd better be carrying a <a href="../Blurbs/Knife.html">Knife</a> or it is impossible to cut the skins to the right size. When you are done you'll have a fine set of Squzskin Gauntlets. They will keep those grubby, grungy, grabby mitts of yours from being skinned. You can carry two sets - one worn and one spare set. Squzskin Gauntlets are <a href="../Items/One.html">Armor Class 1</a>.
