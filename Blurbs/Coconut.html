	Yes, that famous fruit of the Coco tree (Coconut Palm). It abounds in the Sand and Palm terrain of the Island. Monsters pick 'em by clanging their bodies against the tree - riper ones fall (sometimes on one's head, but so what?). Coconuts are a Monster's last resort for food - something you get sick of quick. You can carry three coconuts - if you have less than that, you'll gather more when possible (at no cost in Action Points). Note: The Monster Island Coco palm tree is about 1/3 smaller than a real Coco palm tree. Oh, if you're a loony Monster you can now YELL a new yell: Y 25. This is the &quot;Put a Lime in the Coconut&quot; song. If you want to CONSUME a yummy Coconut, write: U 25. Don't do this often - you'll get sick to your stomach.
