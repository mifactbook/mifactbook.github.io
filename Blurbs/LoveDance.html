		You recall the Love Dance taught you by your Mother when you were a wee girl. You can issue it anytime. However, during the next two game weeks you can get pregnant - and periodically thereafter (you will be given a one week warning each time) - if your dance succeeds.
		Issue the LOVE DANCE order: LD. It takes 6 Action Points. You will search your square and the first male you encounter in this square you will attempt to seduce. [We could go into the graphic details of this, but hey, this is a family game!]
	</p>

	<p>Note: The chances of a little one are considered very good if mating with a male of your own race, and only fair with another Ruk race.</p>
