	This Talisman of the dark is obviously some type of dark , iron armour. Yet how it is to be assembled and worn is a mystery. Disciples of <a href="../Items/Shroud.html">Shroud</a> should bear this item into a Shroud Temple's Inner Sanctum and Kowtow for further revelation. This item can also be placed in any god's Temple Treasure Room. You can carry 1.
