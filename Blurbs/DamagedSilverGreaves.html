<p>
	These <a href="../Items/Greaves.html">leggings</a> are not in the best of shape. Still, they seem to stay on and will provide <a href="../Items/One.html">Armor Class 1</a> protection. But it would be best if you had them repaired by a <a href="../Locations/FarForge.html">Forger</a>. They also provide extra protection against certain foes. You can carry two pairs of them.
