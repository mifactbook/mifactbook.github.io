	For member of the Dark this well-crafted black <a href="../Blurbs/LongSword.html">Long Sword</a> is one of their favourite weapons. It's great for slicing up followers of the light.It is a <a href="../Items/Four.html">Damage Class 4</a> <a href="../Items/Edged.html">Edged</a> weapon, but when wielded against Monsters and creatures of the light, its damage is doubled. It can only be equipped by members of the dark whose Muscle is at least 110. You can carry 1.
