<p>
	This unusual <a href="../Blurbs/Voodoo.html">Voodoo</a> concoction is both difficult to make and difficult to find a place to use it. Use the MAKE order: M 56. You need to be in a square having a <a href="../Locations/Pond.html">pond</a> or <a href="../Locations/Waterhole.html">waterhole</a>, and possess 7 <a href="../Blurbs/PurpleLotusLeaf.html">Purple Lotus Leaves</a>, a <a href="../Blurbs/BloodMiteEye.html">Blood Mite Eye</a>, and a live <a href="../Blurbs/ReptronBird.html">Reptron Bird</a>. Boil these in your <a href="../Blurbs/VoodooCauldron.html">Cauldron</a> for 12 Action Points, making a thick paste. To use the Reptron Salve you must be in a square having a <a href="../Locations/Geyser.html">Geyser</a>. Expend 45 Action Points issuing the USE order: U 56. Rub the salve so that it covers every inch of your body. Then jump head first into the Geyser. The salve protects your skin from the superheated water. The heat causes the salve to become absorbed by your skin, increasing your Skin Toughness. Of course it's gonna hurt. And, don't be tempted to do it a second time. You can carry 9.
