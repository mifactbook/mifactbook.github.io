<div class="info-section">
	<h2>God Symbols</h2>
	<p>This is a vivid, complex Symbol placed by a God on a structure or item. Such Symbols represent that the God has given a bit of his power to the item or structure. Further, it warns non-followers that they're not to touch, equip, or use a certain item, or enter a certain structure. You're most likely to find these Symbols emblazoned on the walls of a God's Temple.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
	<h2>Guardian Statue of a Temple</h2>
	<p>If a certain statue is placed in the proper temple, it becomes a Guardian Statue. This statue becomes a permanent fixture of the Treasure room and keeps an eye on those who enter. The statute will use its magical powers to attack thieves who attempt to plunder the Treasure Room. The Guardian Statue also has a special telepathic connection to the Guardian Monster of the temple.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
	<h2>Temple Guardian Status</h2>
	<p>Temples Guardian status is conferred by a God upon a follower of his who first places a Guardian Statue in a temple of his that does not already have one. The temple may have only one Guardian Monster. The Guardian Monster and his group members receive special attention when Kowtowing at the Guardian's temple. A Guardian has a special order only he can issue at a square having a temple - the GUARD TEMPLE order: GT. It can be done both duing a turn (20 Action Points) and as the very last order of a turn. The special advantages and abilities gained by doing this are a closely guarded secret.</p>
	<p>Note: a monster may have only one special religious status.</p>
	<p>Note: There is no <a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html">Jossman</a> to remind you to sleep inside. GT must be your last order.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
	<h2>Religious Ranks</h2>
	<p>When you become a Follower of a God, you begin at the lowest rank, Neophyte. The next three ranks are Acolyte, Disciple and Priest. To become an Acolyte requires continued loyalty to your God. If you've been a Neophyte for at least 5 weeks, try Kowtowing at an altar stone of your God. Becoming a Disciple requires more and culminates in the Disciple Rite at a Temple of your God. Becoming a Priest is a long and arduous quest. Each time you advance a rank, your ability to identify the religion and rank of other Monsters may improve. Other abilities may improve too. In addition to ranks, each religion has some special titles and positions.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
	<h2>Spell Casting</h2>
	<p>Those who've achieved the rank of Disciple or greater, are able to cast Spells. You can cast any Spell that is either given to you by your God, or obtain by magically reading a Magic Scroll. Most spells have no Action Pt cost. Each spell requires a certain number of Spell Points to be expended in order to cast. You begin with a number of Spell Points and may regain some Spell Points when resting 'Tween turns. You may also regain Spell Points by Kowtowing at Temples. The amount regained is based on Action Points spent Kowtowing and on the treasure in the Temple's Treasure room. If you don't have the right number of Spell Points needed to cast a spell, it's not attempted. Some spells have a longer format: C (Spell#) (Item# or Spell Points).</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
	<h2>Inside a Temple</h2>
	<p>A Temple consists of three connecting rooms. The Outer Room, which also serves as a store room, is entered through the only door. Followers may drop any items here and pickup any item lying here. Use the PLACE order: P (Item#) (Qty), to leave items. Use the BRING order: B (Item#) (Qty) to take items. A door leads to the Treasure Room. Inside are items that are, in theory, being permanently placed in this Temple. Use the XFER TREASURE order: X (Item#) (Qty) to bestow appropriate treasure to the Treasure Room. (Qty must be less than 1000.) A door at the far end of the Treasure Room opens into a very short corridor which ends with the door to the Inner Sanctum. You'll Kowtow directly in front of the huge statue of your God that dominates this small room.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
	<h2>The Chosen</h2>
	<p>The "Chosen" are a rare group of monsters selected by the Gods for special recognition. In many ways they are the ideal that all Desciples strive towards. They are selected for the service that they have rendered to their gos. Chosen are those believed to have the greatest potential to rise in their God's power. Most are warriors and spell-casters of extreme power. They are feared in battle. They are potential leaders of the faith. YOU have been selected to become a Chosen.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
	<h2>Religious Castes</h2>
	<p>The Gods truly understand the basic needs of the Monster races. The need for power and recognition. To be Chosen is not enough. To provide for advancement and growth of their followers, the Gods created the Castes. Warrior and Mage. A way to recognize the elite Monsters and to reward those elite with both power and responsibility. Each caste comes with its own rewards and benefits. Once selected, the Chosen must remain with that Caste until he is no more. Chose wisely my Chosen.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
	<h2>Warrior Caste</h2>
	<p>The primary bent of the Warrior Caste is battle. They seek to master all forms of combat. They harden their bodies and seek battle at every opportunity to test their ability. Magic is useful, but only where it enhances their fighting ability. Death brings no fear except that of failure. The Warrior Caste advances through many ranks: Warrior, Hero, Champion, and Lors. A select few Lords will be chosen to advance into the priesthood and even beyond.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
	<h2>Mage Caste</h2>
	<p>The Mage class turns its focus to the powers bestowed by the Gods. Magic is the focus of their desires. Although they are skilled in the art of battle, it is their spells that make them the most feared of foes. The Mage Caste advances through many stages: Conjurer, Mage, Magus and Adept. Each level brings new powers and wonders to their beck and call. A few Adepts will be chosen to advance into priesthood and beyond. Choose well my Chosen.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
	<h2>Changing Gods</h2>
	<p>If you're already a follower of a God but have not attained the rank of Disciple (or higher) it's possible to follow a different God. To do this you need to Kowtow to that different God at one of his alter stones for exactly 117 Action Points. The penalties for performing this Kowtow are significant - expect to be very weak afterwards.</p>
