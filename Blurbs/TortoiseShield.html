<p>
	A great <a href="../Items/Defensive.html">Shield</a> is hard to find. You can try begging, borrowing or buying. But one of the best is made with your own hands, the Tortoise Shield. You need to have a <a href="../Blurbs/Knife.html">Knife</a> and you need to be able to expend a <a href="../Blurbs/Squzskin.html">Squzskin</a>, a <a href="../Blurbs/GiantTortoiseShell.html">Giant Tortoise Shell</a> and 60 Action Points. The squzskin will be used to fashion the strap and the Knife cuts and trims everything properly. Use the MAKE order: M 44. A Tortoise Shield is an <a href="../Items/Five.html">Armour Class 5</a> Defensive weapon and you can carry just one - if your muscle is at least 120.
