<p>
	This dark black, <a href="../Blurbs/Dragon.html">dragon</a>-shaped, heavy flagon is made from some unknown and virtually indestructable metal. It may actually be a portrayal of <a href="../Items/Kadar.html">Kadar Black</a> the legendary Dragon demigod. It is one of the ancient relic vessels. Long ago, certain liquids were drunk from it that gave special powers to the holder - powers associated with Dragons. Nowadays, discovering such liquids seems very slim. However, it would also make a splendid addition to any god's Temple Treasure Room. You can carry 3.
