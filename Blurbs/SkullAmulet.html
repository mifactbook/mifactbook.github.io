<p>
	This disturbing-looking, blackened skull Amulet may make ignorant Monsters think twice before attacking you. Wear it proudly and display a nasty grin on your face! The actual magical effect of the Amulet is that it improves the accuracy of your missile attacks - you'll hit more often. Only a Viper knows how to use this properly - other races cannot even equip it. You can carry 2.
