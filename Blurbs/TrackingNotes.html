		<li>If in the square you begin your tracking you either find your target or lose the tracks, it'll cost 6 Action Points and you won't move.</li>
			<ul style="margin-left:30px;"><li>You might wish to issue extra movement orders (if you wish to make sure you move 8 squares that turn).</li></ul>
		<li>The TRACK order does not move your Monster toward the square in which you last sighted tracks. First you must move to a square having the tracks you wish to follow.</li>
		<li>There's no way to track unidentified tracks. On the other hand, after meeting a race, you'll be able to identify its tracks thereafter.</li>
		<li>When following Monster tracks and you come across more than one set of its race, you'll follow the most recently made tracks.</li>
