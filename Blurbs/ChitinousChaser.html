<p>
	What could be worse than a giant slug? How about a giant, armoured, carniverous slug with an attitude! The Chitinous Chaser is all that and fast to boot.
	About 20 hands long, this critter is covered with large chitinous belts, and wields a single appendage that ends in a spiked ball.
	A <a href="../Items/Pole.html">Pole</a> weapon would be the best means of attack.
