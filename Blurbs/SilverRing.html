<p>
	This thick, solid silver, and very heavy (for a ring) finger adornment gleams with a highly polished brilliance. Etched on it is a snake that encircles the ring several times. The snake has a head at both ends. This ring provides some protection against certain foes. You can carry any number of rings.
