<p>
	Crafted by one of the skilled <a href="../Blurbs/ZoingoMutant.html">Zoingot</a> jewelers, this ornamental dagger looks precious. It's just over two hands in length and its nicest features are the four small rubies that decorate the hilt. Some <a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html">Jossmen</a> prize such objects. This dagger lacks a sharp edge and would break easily if it were used as a weapon. You can carry 4.
