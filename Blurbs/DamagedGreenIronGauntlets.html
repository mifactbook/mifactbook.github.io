	It's best not to leave these things lying around on the grass as they blend in perfectly. You can imagine sitting behind a bush, waiting in ambush, just to have your prey walk up to you in armoured camoflage. Hopefully, you'll get the full jump on him as these Damaged Green Iron Gauntlets only provide <a href="../Items/Two.html">Armour Class 2</a> protection. You can carry but one pair.
