<p>
	Not as big as a <a href="../Blurbs/SpladderMoth.html">Spladder Moth</a> but certainly big enough to smoosh the average Ruk flat as a pancake, the 4-headed Squish bat is a hideously deformed monstrosity that comes equipped with two sets of leathery wings, four heads, eight jaws, and 13 taloned legs.
	Not your ordinary average beast. <a href="../Blurbs/ZoingoMutant.html">Zoingots</a> swear they had nothing to do with the making of this one.
	How it came into being is anyone's guess. Just be careful in <a href="../Items/Wasteland.html">Wasteland</a> terrain so as not to get, well, squished.
