<p>
	The loveliest of all the <a href="../Items/Defensive.html">shields</a> commonly found on Monster Island, the Blue Iron Shield has the tint of an early evening sky. If appearances are important to you, you've got to have one of these. In addition to its good looks, it also provides <a href="../Items/Four.html">Armor Class 4</a> protection. You can only carry one.
