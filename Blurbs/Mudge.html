<p>
	A Mudge is a 5-7 hand-long lizard with slimy pustules all over its body.
	Most at home in <a href="../Items/Swamp.html">swampy</a> terrain, the Mudge has webbed feet that enable it to move quite swiftly even in sandy terrain.
	The Mudge has an unquenchable thirst and energetically seeks out new liquid sources.
	Since a Monster's body is actually composed of 77% water (or is it 93% fat?), the Mudge will home in and clamp its teeth on you.
	It extends a tongue-like sucker into a wound to eventually drain all the liquid from the victim's body.
	Finish it off with a nasty <a href="../Items/Pointed.html">Pointed</a> weapon.
