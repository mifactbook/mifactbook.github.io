<p>
	This very unpleasant smelling Creature is not one you'll go out of your way to battle. Its shiny, greasy skin can be glaring in bright sunlight.
	What makes it scary though is that it likes to charge... it will race at high speed toward you and then stop suddenly.
	As it just avoids colliding with you it will launch its stench mist through its odd horn, and too often you'll get a lot of it on you.
	The Malador then attacks with its front paws.
