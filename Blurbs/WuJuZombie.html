<p>
	Pity the newly transformed Ruk or native monster victim that has been converted to Undeath and you will find yourself reawakening as the subject of a Wuju Zombie Reanimation Ceremony.
	Most Wuju Zombies are recently created and <a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html">Jossmen</a> tell that it is the meddling of curious Ruks that are causing the trouble.
	Be aware that a Wuju Zombie hates its fate with an all consuming passion.
	It hates you even more because you are still living and if it has its way, you will join it soon.
