<p>
	This small Creature is less than 3 cubic hands in size. It looks like a miniature version of a tough, thick-skinned, flying dragon.
	Its emerald eyes are daunting and the tiny flames that occasionally cough out of its mouth are nearly spellbinding.
	The dragonbat is incredibly difficult to kill because it has no problem escaping anything (or so it would seem) .
	Its high intelligence and curious nature make it always on the move. Always flying here, then there. Ever alert.
