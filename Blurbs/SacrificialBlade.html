<p>
	This twisted Dagger is shaped like a snake. As you test the blade it slices through your finger as it it hungers for the blood. Even stranger, your blood flows straight down the edge of the blade and off the bottom of the hilt. A closer examination reveals a narrow channel etched into the blade to funnel the blood. You're certain you don't want to meet the sick mind that designed this blade. The sacrificial Blade is a <a href="../Items/Four.html">Damage Class 4</a> <a href="../Items/Pointed.html">Pointed</a> Weapon. You can carry only one safely.
