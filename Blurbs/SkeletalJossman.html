<p>
	Just when you thought you had seen it all, along comes te Skeletal <a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html">Jossman</a>.
	It's nothing but bones knit together by some very powerful (and suspicious) magic. And it's definitely not something you wish to mess around with.
	Problem is, unless you are lucky or knowledgeable, you're likely in for the <a href="../Blurbs/Wrestling.html">wrestling</a> match of your life.
	It's best to just follow the word of Jossmen everywhere - stay away from these guys unless you want some serious trouble.
	Because once you find one, you are already in over your head assuming you are still in posession of it.
