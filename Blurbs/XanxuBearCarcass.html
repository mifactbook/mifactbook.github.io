<p>
	Kill a <a href="../XanxuCaveBear/.html">Xanxu Cave Bear</a> and you can detatch the head and legs from the torso and lug the torso around for future use. How you manage to carry two of these things around is a mystery but it makes them less of a burden on your inventory so you shouldn't ask too many questions.
