  - |
    <p>For the elite Monster Island adventurer, having a Mount is a must. Riding a well-trained Mount gives you a great feeling of confidence and superiority. Plus the height advantage allows you to spot the smaller structures and terrain hazards quicker.
    To capture a Mount, you'll need at least a <a href="../Blurbs/JuteRope.html">Jute Rope</a>. Use the CAPTURE order. After capture, to begin riding and training your Mount, issue the TRAIN/WORK MOUNT order: TW. It uses 8 Action Points and shouldn't be
    done more than twice a turn (preferably at beginning and end). Don't overwork your Mount!</p>
    <p> Note: The first time you Train/Work your Mount, it takes 24 Action Points and you'll expend your Jute Rope by making it into a crude harness.
    To release your current Mount, capture another Mount.</p>

    <h2>Riding Skill Levels</h2>
    <p>Upon riding your first Mount, you become a Novice rider. Slowly you will improve and eventually attain the higer skill levels: Fair, Advanced, and Superior. <a href="../Blurbs/Plodder.html">Plodders</a> are the best Mount to learn on because they're the most co-operative.
    However, it's unlikely that you'll attain that the Advanced skill level by riding a Plodder. Other Mounts are terrible to start on (hopeless might be a better word). With each advancement in skill level additional skills and/or abilities are received.</p>
