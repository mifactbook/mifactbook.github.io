<p>
	These are some of the heaviest <a href="../Items/Gauntlets.html">gauntlets</a> you could ever imagine wearing. They are made from an abundant amount of black PigIron and are fashioned to fit Trolls, in most cases, they are just too large to fit the average Ruk. Still , on rare occassions, you may find a pair small enough to fit you. If so, they will provide you with <a href="../Items/Five.html">Class 5</a> protection for your feet and lower legs. You can carry only one pair and they require a muscle of 350 to equip.
