<p>
	This is one dangerous avian. Picture a large buzzard with the beak, talons and speed of an eagle.
	But it's bigger than an eagle and buzzard combined with an unsavory disposition.
	The Hawk Buzzard has a predilection for <a href="../Locations/LargeCave.html"> Large Caves</a>; it's about the only place you'll find them.
	Not that you'd ever be looking for one.
