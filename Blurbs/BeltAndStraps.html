<p>
	This protective magical charm, when equipped, allows a Fatblob to see his own feet, preventing him from tripping. This decreases the chances of a Fatblob from falling into <a href="../Locations/Quicksand.html">quicksand</a>
	and all types of <a href="../Locations/DeepPit.html">pits</a>. Of course it does not fit other races. You can carry 2.
