<p>
	Both the hilt and the point of this dagger are damaged. It is useless until it is repaired by a capable <a href="../Locations/FarForge.html">Forger</a>. An undamaged one rates <a href="../Items/Two.html">Damage Class 2</a> and is excellent against foes vulnerable to silver weaponry. You can carry two.
