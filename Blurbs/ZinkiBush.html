blurb: 'The Zinki Bush is a fairly common greenish-yellow bush found in <a href="../Items/SandPalms.html"> Sand &amp; Palms</a> terrain. Its buds are pointed and if you get caught in a clump of them it can be a bloody chore to work your way free. If you are careful, you can collect up to 6 buds and dry them in the sun. You''ll do this automatically, at no cost in Action Points, but only if you have a <a href="../Blurbs/BlowPipe.html">Blow Pipe</a>. After the buds have dried and hardened, they are fired from a Blow Pipe'
