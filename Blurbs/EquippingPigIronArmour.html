		PigIron is a substance that has a remarkable affinity for magic. Many very potent spells work only on items made of PigIron. One of these spells is the "Prevent Theft" spell practiced by most races of <a href="../Blurbs/RockTroll.html">Trolls</a>.
		This spell automatically reviews the size of the person putting on the armour and "If it does not fit, you must split." Actually, the armour erupts in a ball of fire and magically disintegrates to dust. If the thief is unlucky, he may even get hurt.
		Occasionally, though, you might find some PigIron armour that fits perfectly. In this case, you are in great luck and can wear it though if you grow while wearing it and then take it off, it may no longer fit you and will explode.
