	It sure looks good! If your eyes looked like this ring you'd be positively frightening. This ring was made by some talent-lacking hedge-wizard because all it does is glow. But its a nice glow. Keep it, wear it, or toss it. The <a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html">Jossmen</a> don't want it. You can carry any number of rings.
