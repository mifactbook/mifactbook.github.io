<p>
	This large, bird-like creature is a distant cousin of the ostrich. One difference is that this one has abnormally large teeth, which are very sharp.
	The King Emu is also carniverous in its diet, meaning you could well end up being its next meal.
	Like the ostrich, it can't fly, but it runs faster than you might think. Try to <a href="../Items/Bashing.html">club</a> it into submission.
