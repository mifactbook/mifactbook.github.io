<p>
	This small, evil-looking, hand-carved statuette feels wonderful to hold (if you're a <a href="../Items/Shroud.html">Shroud</a> Follower). The carver was quite skillful and gave Shroud a fittingly menacing appearance.
	The statue is made from aKlinwood and polished or lacquered in some way that its surface is both very hard and somewhat shiny (almost glowing). This statue has one proper place: a <a href="../Items/Shroud.html">Shroud Temple</a>
	Treasure Room. In fact, it's very important for a Shroud Temple to have one of these statues. You can carry 1.
