		The return of <a href="../Items/Kadar.html">Kadar</a>, <a href="../Items/Yasmin.html">Yasmin</a> and the other Demigods have greatly disrupted the balance of power on the Island. The magic needed to make their return was stolen directly from the basic magical weave that sustains Monster Island.
		Their return disrupted my power as well. To stabilize my presence in your world, I was forced to draw power from the Talismans bestowed by my followers. Now the power of the Three is tied to the number of our followers and the gifts they bestow in our Temples. only Talismans add to my power and only
		those given since the Return. You must work to increase the number of my Followers. Only by growing in Followers and stored magic can I help you. Seek Talismans for my Temples. Increase my power and I will be with you. I will mark you as my chosen.
