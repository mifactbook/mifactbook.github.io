<p>
	This 8-hand long, dark-colored Creature roams the <a href="../Items/SandPalms.html">Sand and Palms</a> terrain in search of food.
	Its tail contains two stingers. But it only attacks with one of them - the poisonous one.
	The other is the antidote, which it injects into its kill (making it edible to the scorpion).
