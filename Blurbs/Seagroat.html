<p>
	Barely fluttering over the ground this avian is really strange to watch. It hovers from spot to spot, like a low-flying hummingbird.
	But the Seagroat resembles a flaming yellow whooping crane, with a home not too far from the sea.
	A <a href="../Items/Bashing.html">club</a> can turn one into a yummy meal (seafood au groatin?) - and rather quickly too.
