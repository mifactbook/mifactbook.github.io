		Were you expecting a tall pointy hat and magical staff? Well, you are in luck. When you attract a Wizard to a <a href="../Locations/Tower.html">Tower</a> you get a Wizard in your Tower.
		Actually, Wizards are the smartest fraction of the native island monster population. They are hugely ancient <a href="../Blurbs/ZoingoMutant.html">Zoingots</a>, trained in the arcane arts.
		The fact is, they are so ancient that they have just two arms, two legs, and one head. Most were students of the greatest Wizard of all - Xanxu. But a word to the wise (doesn't that sound funny being said to a Ruk?),
		don't screw around with Wizards unless newtdom is a goal of yours.
