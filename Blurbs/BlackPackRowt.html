<p>
	Black Pack Rowts are the leaders of the pack! The smaller, Grey Pack Rowts follow them faithfully.
	Only the Black Pack Rowt is large enough to attack a Monster.
	If the Black Pack Rowt is able to kill its prey (you?), the entire pack will drag it back to their hole and feast.
	Killing a Black Pack Rowt makes a meal.
	You will usually spot them in <a href="../Items/Sticks.html">sticks</a> and <a href="../Items/LowHills.html">hilly</a> terrain.
	Being equipped with some sort of <a href="../Items/Missile.html">missile</a> weapon would be awfully smart.
