<p>
	Thrump, thrump, kerthrump. Greet this very large Creature in a friendly manner or be sorry.
	Light gray with yellow tinges, it's about the size and shape of an elephant, but thinner and faster.
	Although you have to watch out so that you're not trampled by one, you also have to worry about its two frightening-looking tusks.
	Yeow! The Tusker roams many terrains but dislikes wet and hilly ones.
	It's also one of The Omniscient's favourites - those who kill one may feel Fuvah's wrath..
