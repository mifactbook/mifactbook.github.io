<p>
	Darn near a monster race, the Sistratelli are a large, leather-winged race of flying reptiles that live in small caves on the side of cliffs or holes in the boles of large trees.
	They attack by diving at you from the air and trying to pluck you from the ground with with their large, toothy beaks or rip you to shreads with their stronged talons.
