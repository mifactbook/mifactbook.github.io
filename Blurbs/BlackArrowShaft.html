<p>
	The shaft of the Black Arrow is a thing of perfection. a such, it takes almost perfect conditions to craft one.Should you be lucky enough to find a <a href="../Blurbs/BlackLotus.html">Black Lotus Shrub</a> that has ripened, you must look for the straightest branch and carefully cut it to a length of 7 hands. Too short and it lacks power, too long and it will snap. You must then attach 3 <a href="../Blurbs/DemonCondorFeather.html">Demon Condor Feathers</a> as fletching. To make the Black Arrow Shaft, issue the M 132 Order. It takes 55 APs. You can carry only one.
