<p>
	Disguised as rocks in <a href="../Items/Swamp.html">Swamp</a> terrain, these mushrooms are feared by Monsters every- where. Okay, not exactly feared. It's just that you can't help jumping when you step on what looks like a firm rock and nearly twist your ankle while an ugly squishing noise fills your ears. Unsettling, that's it! Once you recover your composure you'll pick up three of 'em (the maximum you can carry). Someday get revenge by cooking 'em in a <a href="../Blurbs/VoodooCauldron.html">Voodoo Cauldron</a>.
