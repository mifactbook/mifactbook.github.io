<p>
	This little bugger is sneaky and clever. When it is around, never and we do mean never drop your defenses.
	If oyu do, it will spring on you from behind and try to throttle th life out of you with its enormously strong and spiney legs.
	If you keep your wits about you, you can usually turn the tables on this beastie and be rewarded with a bucket full of slimey roach guts. Yuck.
