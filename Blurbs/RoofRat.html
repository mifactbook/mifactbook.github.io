<p>
	Look up above you! It's not a bird, nor a bat, nor a dragon.
	It's a Roof Rat! They scamper from vine to ledge to stalactite chittering away with their grizzly teeth.
	Fortunately, only one attacks at a time, but often a second follows, and sometimes more.
	And then what happens? Only the hardiest Monsters survive to tell Roof Rat Horror Tales.
