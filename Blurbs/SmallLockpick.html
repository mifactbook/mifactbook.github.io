	Crafted in fine iron, this lockpick can crack most locked chests, jewellry boxes, and a few other things. Lockpicks are quite rare - hold onto it! You'll also want to have someone skilled in the use of lockpicks teach you haw to work it - without breaking it. To use it, issue the USE order: U 397. It takes 2 Action Points. First you'll try to use it on a small lock at the place you're at, if such an opportunity exists. Second, you'll try to use it on any of your posessions that have a small lock. There's no limit to the number of small lockpicks you can carry.
