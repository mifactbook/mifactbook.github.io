	<p>So you've been stumbling around the island for Kabuki-knows-how-long and you've never had the sense to empty the trash? What a numnut. If you find yourself taking a dislike to certain items and wishing you had the good sense not to keep carrying them around, just try out the WEEKLY RID order. If you issue the order: WR (Item#), you will make yourself a list and every time you make camp, you'll review what you've got in your possession and, if it's on the list, you'll get rid of it. To take an item off the list, just issue the order again. Ya gotta wonder why you never thought of this before. You can remember to Weekly Rid up to 15 items. It costs no action points to issue this order.</p>
