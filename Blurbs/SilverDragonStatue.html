	Roughly 6 cubic hands in size, this hollow, shiny statuette is quite striking to behold. The silversmith who made it was obviously trained by the <a href="../Blurbs/ZoingoMutant.html">Zoingots</a> - no one else has such skill with silver.

This statue would be a valuable addition to any God's Temple Treasure Room. You can carry 1
