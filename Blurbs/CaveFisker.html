<p>
	This devilish creature is as much at home above ground as it is below ground.
	Its insectoid body comes equipped with huge long hind legs made for jumping and long antennae tor finding its way around in the dark.
	Its hind legs can pack quite a punch since they are covered with remarkably strong spines that can rip you to pieces and their head is equipped with ovrsized mandibles capable of putting the bite on anything smaller than your head.
	Their impressive speed makes them a danger in the open and even more so in an enclosed space.
