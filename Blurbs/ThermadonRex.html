<p>
	Yes, this is the large-sized Thermadon. This one comes with wings and is about 3 times bigger.
	It uses claws and sharp wings in an attempt to shred a foe into a bloody heap.
	Thermadon Rex are also covered with sharp scales which can cut an unprotected Monster quite nicely.
	While no match for a <a href="../Blurbs/Dragon.html">Dragon</a>, the Thermadon Rex is deadly enough that even a Dragon will choose to go around its territory.
