<p>
	The black and gray avian resembles a bat in some ways. Its large wings have sharp points at the tips.
	Combine these wings with its great speed and it becomes obvious that the Daggerbird is one fearsome dive bombing hit-and-run artist.
	Only those skilled with a great <a href="../Items/Edged.html">edged</a> weapon stand a decent chance of grounding this threat from the skies.
