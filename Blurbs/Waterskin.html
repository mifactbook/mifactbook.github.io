<p>
	Water is not pleantyful everywhere on the Island. You can fashion a leather Waterskin in squares where <a href="../Blurbs/ClakkSnakkar.html">Clakk Snakkars</a> reside. Issue the MAKE order: M 42. You'll need a <a href="../Blurbs/Knife.html">knife</a> and it takes 18 Action Points. You can carry two.
