<p>
	This impressive looking <a href="../Items/Defensive.html">shield</a> is taller than most monsters and wider than a <a href="../Blurbs/Fatblob.html">Fatblob</a>. Yet despite its size, it is light and easy to handle. So light in fact, that most any monster should be able to equip it. You have never heard of such wonderous defensive weapon before. The intricate designs and markings etched into the surface of the shield leave you with a feeling that you have visited a holy place. The Keeth Tower Shield is an ultra rare item that is only carried by Avatar's of the Gods. That or by someone who was foolish enough to incur the wrath of the Gods by killing an Avatar. It is a <a href="../Items/Nine.html">Class 9</a> Defensive weapon. There are only two and you can carry but one.
