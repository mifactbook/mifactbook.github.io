title: Jossmen
blurb: |
  <p>This is the race of Monsters who run the <a href="../Locations/FarInn.html">Far Inns</a> and <a href="../Locations/FarPost.html">Far Posts</a>.
  They come from far to the East - a place they call the Civilized Kingdom. They also call it Lavodor, and it is ruled by the Great Lavodorian King.
  A Jossman is smaller than any of the Seven Monster races but also fleeter of foot. They're fairly friendly, welcoming company, but their nostrils
  flare violently when angered. They seem to enjoy life in the wilderness. They wear practical tunics. Every Jossman has some skill with weaponry -
  many are adept with several weapon classes.</p>
