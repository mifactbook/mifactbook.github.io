<p>
	Sometimes called Flying Snouts, although they can't actually fly, Snouts are pig-shaped, dark gray in colour, and always seem to be on the go.
	They have very sizable snouts, but are not aggressive and make excellent Monster food.
	They are known for their seemingly long treks and for their high-pitched squealing snort.
