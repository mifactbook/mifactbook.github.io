<p>
	What more could a Knight in Shining Armor want than a shiney Ivory Iron <a href="../Items/Helmets.html">Helm</a>? This Damaged Ivory Iron Helm is the next best thing. It's obviously been used and abused and is in need of the attention of a good <a href="../Locations/FarForge.html">Forger</a>, but it still provides <a href="../Items/Two.html">Armor Class 2</a> protection and can be readily mended. If you are lucky enough to find as many, you can carry up to two.
