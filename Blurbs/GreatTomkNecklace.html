<p>
	Often the most dangerous <a href="../Blurbs/Loggerhead.html">Loggerheads</a> are equipped with this Magical <a href="../Items/Amulets.html">Amulet</a>. It's very similar to a <a href="../Blurbs/TomkNecklace.html">Tomk Necklace</a>, but has a higher quality of knick knacks. What makes it special is its Magical ability to reduce damage received from most forms of <a href="../Items/Missile.html">Missile</a> fire to almost nothing. It must be equipped for it to work.
