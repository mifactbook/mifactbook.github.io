<p>
	Not just a really big deer, but the King of deerdom. It's quite intelligent and adept at avoiding battle and ducking missile-fire.
	This Stag is about the size of a Moose, but with sharper, pointer antlers. Its mottled brown fur makes it a bit difficult to spot.
	It finds favour with The Omniscient One.
