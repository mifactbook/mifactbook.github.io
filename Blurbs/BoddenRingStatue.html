<p>
	The Bodden Ring Statue is one of an incredible piece of artwork. It depicts a very muscular <a href="../Blurbs/Bodden.html">Bodden</a> seated on the ground.
	The Bodden holds a large post in each hand and has a third post carefully balanced between his feet. The spacing between the statue and each post is very small and very precise.
	Almost as if this statue was meant to serve a purpose. Rumor has it these statues are closely linked with the tracking of Bodden family lines. But only a Bodden is likely to know how.
	This beautiful statue would be a welcome adition to any <a href="../Blurbs/Gods.html">Treasure Room</a>. You can carry but one.
