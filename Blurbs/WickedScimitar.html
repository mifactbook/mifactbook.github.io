<p>
	This weapon was created to accomplish more than just defeating an enemy. It was meant to cause great pain. This solid black blade carries the same shape and great weight of other scimitars, but the iron has been fired to carry a very sharp edge. Notched into the dark blade are small teeth meant to rip and tear as the blade pulls free. This evil looking weapon is a <a href="../Items/Six.html">Damage Class 6</a> <a href="../Items/Edged.html">Edged</a> weapon. It requires a muscle of at least 275 to use it without hurting oneself. You can carry one.
