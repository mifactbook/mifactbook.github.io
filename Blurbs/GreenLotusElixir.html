<p>
	If you ever had one of those "Bad Zargnoth Days" then you'll appreciate the power of Green Lotus Elixir. It gives that very special 'umph' that a beat up monster really needs. Making it is simple. Combine one <a href="../Blurbs/WhiteLotusElixir.html">White Lotus Elixir</a>, one <a href="../Blurbs/Oil.html">oil</a> and one <a href="../Blurbs/SlinkBauble.html">Slink Bauble</a> (you knew that had to have some use) in your <a href="../Items/Vessel.html">voodoo cauldron</a>, mix for a whopping 18 Action Points, and 'voila' there it is. Use the USE order (U 258) to consume this magical elixir. You can carry up to 50 of these.
