<p>
	This large ornamental pin was crafted by a <a href="../Blurbs/ZoingoMutant.html">Zoingo</a> jeweller long ago. The diamond at the centre is flawed but is still very stunning. Some <a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html">Jossmen</a>
	collect these broaches. Although not to be magical in nature, it can be equipped as a charm. You can carry 11.
