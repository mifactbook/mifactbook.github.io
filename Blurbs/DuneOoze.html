<p>
	In sandy terrain lives the Dune Ooze. It is a mass of translucent greenish-tan slime.
	This disgusting mass is controlled by a single nerve bundle that changes locations as the Creature moves. Killing the Dune Ooze is a matter of timing.
	You must hit the moving nerve center. The Dune Ooze fights back by forming an appendage to clobber you.
