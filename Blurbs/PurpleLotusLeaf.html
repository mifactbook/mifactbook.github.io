<p>
	This is the easiest of the Lotus leaves to find. Its strange smell indicates that in the hands of someone skilled in the art of <a href="../Blurbs/Voodoo.html">Voodoo</a> it may produce some remarkable elixirs. It's commonly found growing in bunches hidden beneath dense vegetation. You need to wait until this shrub's spotted purple leaves turn to all-purple, which happens every couple of weeks. There is no limit to the number of leaves you can carry.
