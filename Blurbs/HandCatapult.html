<p>
	This nifty weapon os a variation on the sling shot and is crafted from a root found in <a href="../Items/Swamp.html">Swamp</a> terrain. To make a Hand Catapult, write a MAKE order: M 5 (while in Swamp terrain). It takes 32 Action Points. The Hand Catapult is a <a href="../Items/Missile.html">Missile</a> Weapon of <a href="../Items/Two.html">Damage Class 2</a>. You can carry just two. The <a href="../Blurbs/SmallRoundRock.html">Small Round Rocks</a> used by a <a href="../Blurbs/Sling.html">Sling</a> are also the ammo for a Hand Catapult.
