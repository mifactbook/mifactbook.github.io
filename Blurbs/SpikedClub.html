<p>
	The idea more than once crosses your mind that a <a href="../Blurbs/CarvedClub.html">Carved Club</a> doesn't do sufficient damage, but that if you enhanced it, it would. <a href="../Blurbs/Porququill.html">Porququills</a> would do the trick! If you acquire fifteen quills from the <a href="../Blurbs/Porqubeast.html">Porqubeast</a> you can drive them into your Carved Club and create a Spiked Club. Then not only can you bash the Creatures that attack but you can punch a few holes in them to boot. To fashion a Spiked Club you need a Carved Club, 15 Porququills, and 45 Action Points. Issue the MAKE order: M 45. The Spiked Club is a <a href="../Items/Bashing.html">Bashing</a> weapon of <a href="../Items/Four.html">Damage Class 4</a>. You can carry one. [Note: If you're currently equipped with a Carved Club and make a Spiked Club, you'll automatically be equipped with the Spiked Club.]
