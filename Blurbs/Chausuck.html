<p>
	Fierce and primitive, the Chasucks stand about 14 hands tall. They walk upright and resemble sharks, giving off a strong, fishy smell.
	Powerfully built, they land devastating blows with their fists and painful bites with mouths which are filled with rows of teeth.
	They have tough, deep-blue skin, which is a very effective natural armour.
	A <a href="../Items/Pointed.html">pointed</a> weapon would be the most effective.
	When travelling through <a href="../Items/Jungle.html">Jungle</a> and <a href="../Items/Sticks.html">Sticks</a>, they often lean back to shake their heads, making a maraca-like sound which other creatures have come to fear.
	A Chusuck is evil-minded and will attack almost anything. Where one is found, others are near.
