	This may be one of the most unusual blades you have ever seen. It has a strangely curved blade that grows wider near the hilt. This sword is so light that it's like using a child's toy. However, it has good balance and it comes to an incredibly sharp point that seems ideal for attacking from the back of your <a href="../Blurbs/Mounts.html">mount</a>. Too bad your stupid <a href="../Blurbs/Plodder.html">Plodder</a> is alergic to combat The Cavalry Sabre is a <a href="../Items/Two.html">Damage Class 2</a> <a href="../Items/Edged.html">Edged</a> weapon. You can carry one.
