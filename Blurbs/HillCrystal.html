<p>
	<a href="../Items/CrystalHills.html">Crystal Hills</a> are the most jagged terrain imaginable. They are so sharp that if you tried to cross them they would cut you to ribbons.
	In surrounding terrain you can often find small pieces of crystal that have eroded off. These have lost their edge and are pretty but worthless. If you happen to use a <a href="../Blurbs/ScorpionTail.html">Scorpion Tail/Fork</a>
	next to Crystal Hills though you will find that its unique properties will shatter a portion of the hill and provide you with a handful of Hill Crystal. You can carry up to 10 of these but they are very sharp so be very careful.
