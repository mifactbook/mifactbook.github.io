	Annoyed by cackling, feathered avians? Is there one in particular you wish to capture? If you answered yes, the Bird Trap is just what you need. It can capture only small or medium sized birds stupid enough to enter its confines. To regularly set the trap at the end of each turn, issue the USSE order: U 38. If you're lucky and have located the trap properly, you'll be rewarded with the capture of an avian. Trapping birds occurs 'Tween turns. To cease using your Bird Trap issue U 38 again. You may have one Bird Trap and only one captured Creaure. Upon a successful capture, you'll cease using your Bird Trap.
