<p>
	The smallest of all carniverous <a href="../Blurbs/Roaches.html">roaches</a>, the Common Cave Roach is, at best, a nuisance, and at worst, just the beginning of worse things to come.
	It is small, only about 4 hands in length and has a nasty habit of flying right into your face and trying to suck out your eyeballs.
	Most impolite! These roaches tend to congregate together and when you run into one, you'll usually find more.
	Its best to turn tail and run before you are overcome with their gross smell and culinary habits.
