<p>
	Just what every villain needs, an evil-looking Black Iron <a href="../Items/Defensive.html">Shield</a> to hide behind in the dark and shadows. Hiding behind this shield will make one less visible on a dark night ambush. It also provides <a href="../Items/Four.html">Armor Class 4</a> protection and you can only carry one.
