<p>
	Crawling in and about <a href="../Locations/TombOfMumi.html">Tombs</a> and <a href="../Locations/AncientGraveyard.html">Graveyards</a> is this unfriendly critter, the Tomb Leech.
	It looks like a short-legged dog disguised as a giant leech. Its sucker is formidable.
	Using <a href="../Items/Edged.html">Edged</a> Weapons is best as you really need to hack it to pieces to kill it.
	It moves silently; its dark color makes it hard to spot.
