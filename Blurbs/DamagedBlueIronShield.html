<p>
	A lovely shade of blue, this Damaged Blue Iron <a href="../Items/Defensive.html">Shield</a> was once the envy of monsters. Now it is dented and beat up, but still has great potential, if only you can find a <a href="../Locations/FarForge.html">Forger</a> to fix it. As it is, it provides <a href="../Items/Two.html">Armor Class 2</a> protection. You can only carry one.
