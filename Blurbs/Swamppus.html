<p>
	In the <a href="../Items/Swamp.html">Swamps</a> is a Creature simply called the Swamppus.
	It is swamp-water coloured, large as a bull, and has the claws of a tiger.
	It can't move quickly, but it can follow you for days on end without tiring, with its slow, lumbering gait.
	The Swamppus looks unusual because on of its front paws is twice the size of the other. The claws on this paw are much more deadly.
	Its carcass is inedible.
