	The Forger notices you have a few coins in your possession and grins. He explains that in addition to putting a coat of silver on some of your weapons, he also knows the secret of coating them with Iron.
	The main disadvantage is that the items are less effective against creatures that take silver to hit. On the plus side, Iron is heavy and the extra weight adds a Damage Class to the basic weapon.
	The Forger charges 100 <a href="../Blurbs/Ocular.html">Oculars</a> to coat the items with iron and you must pump the bellows (80 APs). Issue the Make order: M (Item#) in a <a href="../Locations/FarForge.html">Forge</a> square
</p>

<p>Note: you need the basic item that's not silver coated</p>

	The Spiked CLub has long been a favorite weapon for monsters. Something about punching lots of little holes in ones foe seems to bring out the best in a Monster. What could be better??? Why punching lots of big holes in your foe.
	The Jossman Forge Master had coated this Spiked Club with a thin coating of Iron. He has covered the end of the club to add weight and coated each of the protruding quills. The Quills have each been filed to a very nasty point.
	The Iron Spiked Club is a <a href="../Items/Five.html">Damage Class 5</a> <a href="../Items/Bashing.html">Bashing</a> weapon. You can carry but one of these impressive clubs. You must have a muscle of at least 255 to equip this heavy club.
