<p>
	Masquerading as an innocent looking tree covered in moss, the Faux Masuss is one of the most ingenious creatures around.
	You may stop to take a nap beneath its willowy branches only to find its moss-like tendrils quickly wrap around you and squeeze the life right out of you.
	Luckily this creature can be dispatched with most any good weapon.
