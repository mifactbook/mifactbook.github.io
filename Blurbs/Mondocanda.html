<p>
	Forty hands long worth of coiled fury just waiting for a meal of kicking Ruk.
	This beast is even larger than a <a href="../Blurbs/GreatTrapSnake.html">Great Trap Snake</a> and has a meaner disposition to boot.
	If you want to continue your travels on the Island, you'd best equip with a good blade and slash to kill as quickly as possible.
	The only good thing about this snake is that it provides a very good meal for you and a friend.
