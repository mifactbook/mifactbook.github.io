<p>
	Once you have fashioned the <a href="../Blurbs/BlackArrowShaft.html">Black Arrow Shaft</a> and <a href="../Blurbs/BlackArrowHead.html">Arrowhead</a>, they must be joined seamlessly by <a href="../Blurbs/Voodoo.html">voodoo</a>. Dangle the Ebony Shaft in a river for 200 APs and then fuse the arrowhead to it. Issue the M 134 order.
