<div class="info-section">
	<p>Your two best guesses on how to rid yourself of the pesky <a href="../Blurbs/GnitGnat.html">Gnitgnat</a> swarm that has been following you around are: Dig yourself a <a href="../Locations/HideyHole.html">Hidey-Hole</a> and end your turn's movement in it. The other is to travel through dense terrain, such as <a href="../Items/Jungle.html">Jungle</a>. Who knows if either will work? And of course, with all the crazy Creature parts you and your friends have been collecting, there must be some kind of salve or potion that'll keep Gnitgnat Swarms from following you in the first place.</p>
