<p>
	Glowing with the red of blood, this Damaged Red Iron <a href="../Items/Helmets.html">Helm</a> once sat upon the head of someone obsessed with the glory of battle. Apparently, someone else got the best of them and they lost their helm (or worse). With a little help from a <a href="../Locations/FarForge.html">Forger</a> this helm will provide excellent protection. Until then, you'll have to settle for <a href="../Items/Two.html">Armor Class 2</a> protection. You can carry two.
