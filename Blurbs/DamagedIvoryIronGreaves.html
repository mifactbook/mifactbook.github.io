	Just what the Knight in the White Hat needs, white leggings. These Damaged White Iron <a href="../Items/Greaves.html">Greaves</a> are not the perfect combat-wear, but they do provide <a href="../Items/Two.html">Armor Class 2</a> protection. A little visit to the <a href="../Locations/FarForge.html">Forger</a> will spiff them up nicely. You can carry one pair.
