<p>
	Slash, hack and thrust home! This gleaming <a href="../Blurbs/LongSword.html">Long Sword</a> is well-balanced and finely made. The Light Sword is the bane of <a href="../Items/Shroud.html">Followers of the Dark</a>. It is a <a href="../Items/Four.html">Damage Class 4</a> <a href="../Items/Edged.html">Edged</a> weapon but when wielded agains Monsters and Creatures of the Dark its damage is doubled. It can only be equipped by a <a href="../Items/Kabuki.html">Follower of the Light</a> whose muscle is at least 110. You can carry 1.
