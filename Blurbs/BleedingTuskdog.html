<p>
	This is another of the nasty brutes found lurking in <a href="../Items/Wasteland.html">wasteland</a> terrain.
	The Bleeding Tuskdog comes equipped with eight hugely sharp tusks and instead of the typical slobbering of most canines, this one drools blood.
	It makes for quite the charming companion on those wonderful trips through they otherwise boring Wasteland.</div></td></tr> </table> <br></br> </div> </body> </html>
