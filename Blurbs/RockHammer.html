	Tap, Tap, Tap, Crack. This little hammer is just the thing for cracking that hard to crack rock...or head. It is specifically made for prospecting and not extensive rock moving, still, if you've nothing more than your bare hands, you'll appreciate this finely made piece of equipment. As an added bonus, it will also do <a href="../Items/Two.html">Damage Level 2</a> as a <a href="../Items/Bashing.html">Bashing</a> Weapon.
