<p>
	The large, chameleon-like Squeezy Snake can completely blend into its surroundings. It will try to catch you unaware and loop its body around you.
	Then it constricts tightly to hold you while its fangs slash at you.
	Lotsa fun! If you don't freak out, try bashing its head with a <a href="../Items/Bashing.html">club</a>.
	This snake is most likely found in <a href="../Items/SandPalms.html">Sand & Palms</a> terrain.
