<p>
	Just what every "Good Guy" needs, a pair of Ivory Iron <a href="../Items/Gauntlets.html">Gauntlets</a>. Providing an excellent <a href="../Items/Three.html">Armor Class 3</a> protection to your good-guy hands, they also cut a dashing figure when you are wandering around town. Best of all, they seem to magically repel dirt and grime and are often the only clean thing on a Ruk. You can carry one pair.
