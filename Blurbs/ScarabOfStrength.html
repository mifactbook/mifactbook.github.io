	Ever found yourself a little weak for some burdensome task? Ever need just a little more muscle to equip an item? Well this Scarab is for you. Equip it as a charm and you'll add an extra 100 muscle (all magical, of course) to your frame.
	Take it off and the muscle goes away. You can carry one of these and it is equipped as a charm.
