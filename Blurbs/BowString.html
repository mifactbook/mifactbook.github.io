<p>
	Found in Jungle terrain is the enormous Phylo Vine. Its trunk is as big around as your leg and its mammoth leaves grow over 14 hands in length. Large runs of Phylo Vines in a square can make for tough travel. If you issue the MAKE order: M 65 (taking 6 Action Points), you can remove the outer leafy covering and extract the vein from inside the leaf. These veins have the perfect elasticity and durability for use as a Bow String. You may carry a dozen of them.
