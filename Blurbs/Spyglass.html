<p>
	Spyglasses are great! They enable you to both discern the terrain of all squares one away and spot the larger structures (such as <a href="../Locations/LargeCave.html">Large Caves</a> and <a href="../Locations/FarInn.html">Far Inns</a>) in these squares. To fabricate a Spyglass, issue the MAKE order: M 24. You need the right three parts: a <a href="../Blurbs/BlackPackRowtLens.html">Black Pack Rowt Lens</a>, a <a href="../Blurbs/YogorillaLens.html">Yogorilla Lens</a>, and a <a href="../Blurbs/FunnelSnakeskin.html">Funnel Snakeskin</a>. It takes 10 Action Points to make. You can carry just one and you'll use it whenever it's opportune.
