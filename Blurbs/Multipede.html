<p>
	Ten hands long, black as night, equipped with poisonous glands the length of its body.
	Its body broken into a thousand segments, each one bearing four-clawed legs.
	Meet the Multipede, a resident of the dark where it feeds on the dregs of matter that enter its dark realm.
	If you invade this realm you may find it has developed a taste for living Ruk.
	Beware the sound of its multi-feet in the dark as it means you have seen the last of the sunlight and have met your doom.
