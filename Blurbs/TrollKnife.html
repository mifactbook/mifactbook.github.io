<p>
	It's hard to imagine anyone being able to use this as a <a href="../Blurbs/Knife.html">knife</a>. It is closer in size to a <a href="../Blurbs/LongSword.html">Long Sword</a>. But then again, it was made to be used by a Troll and Trolls like things large. A close look at the blade shows that it is finely serated giving it the ability to deliver <a href="../Items/Five.html">Level 5</a> Damage as a <a href="../Items/Pointed.html">Pointed</a> Weapon. You can carry only one Troll Knife and it takes 300 muscle to use in battle.
