<p>
	A Yogorilla looks a lot like an over- stuffed slightly hairy gorilla.
	Yogorillas are not aggressive (being herbivorous), but are still quite annoying because they are forever yelling, "Yo! Yo! Yo!?" It can drive anyone crazy.
	It seems to love the <a href="../Items/LowHills.html">hilly</a> terrains and it's rare to find one in some other type of terrain.
