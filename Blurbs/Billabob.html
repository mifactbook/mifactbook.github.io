	Step...Bob...Step...Bob...Step...Jab. So goes life for the Billabob. This bird-like creature is an expert at spearing prey.
	In fact, it is so efficient that it often spears more than it can eat, leaving it to walk around with an assortment of small, medium, and large creatures skewered on its bill...a veritable 'billobob.'
