<p>
	This helm has two big cracks in it and will occasionally slip off your head. Still, it provides <a href="../Items/One.html">Armour Class 1</a> protection. Better yet, have it repaired by a <a href="../Locations/FarForge.html">Forger</a> because an undamaged <a href="../Blurbs/SilverHelm.html">Silver Helm</a> provides <a href="../Items/Two.html">Armour Class 2</a> protection. Because it is crafted from silver, it provides additional protection against certain foes. You can carry two of them.
