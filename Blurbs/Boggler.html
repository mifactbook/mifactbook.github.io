<p>
	One of <a href="../Items/Graggolos.html">Graggolos'</a> <a href="../Blurbs/LesserGargoyles.html">Lesser Gargoyles</a>, the Boggler is pure fighting power wrapped in a granite exterior.
	Its large red eyes seem to stare at you with warning and it will always give you a chance to run before using its obsidian-sharp claws to slash your face to fleshy ribbins.
	Of course, you can always be unlucky and actually get past it.
	But realize that being Graggolos' best Guardian means it's usually located around places you might not want to go.
