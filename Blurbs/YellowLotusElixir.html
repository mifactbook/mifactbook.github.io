<p>
	"Yelled Out" and need a cure? Or perhaps you'd like your yell to carry further? Then you need this elixir. In to a <a href="../Blurbs/VoodooCauldron.html">Voodoo Cauldron</a> shred one <a href="../Blurbs/YellowLotusLeaf.html">Yellow Lotus Leaf</a>. Add 1 <a href="../Blurbs/Oil.html">Oil</a> and a pinch of sand (i.e. you must be in <a href="../Items/SandPalms.html">Sand & Palms</a> terrain to be able to make this elixir). Cook the concoction for 7 Action Points. To perform this action write the MAKE order: M 35. To USE/CONSUME the elixir write: U 35. If you are "Yelled Out" you'll be cured. Otherwise, the elixir will extended your yell range significant lead for the remainder of this turn (only). It may be extremely hazardous to use this elixir more than once in an eight-day span. There's no limit to the number of elixir you can carry.
