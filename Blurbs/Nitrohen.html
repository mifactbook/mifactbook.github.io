<p>
	Pure red and resembling a 50lb chicken with a shark-like mouth, this large egg-laying fowl is most often found in <a href="../Items/Sticks.html">sticks</a> terrain, nesting in a clump of bamboo.
	These birds are fiercely protective of their nests and will attack anything that comes near.
	As Nitrohens charge at their foe, using a <a href="../Items/Pole.html">pole</a> weapon to skewer the bird upon has the most effect.
	The nest of a Nitrohen may contain up to 3 <a href="../Blurbs/Nitroegg.html">eggs</a>.
