<p>
	Often seen sliding over the surface of <a href="../Items/Swamp.html">swampy</a> muck is the Muck Daudler.
	Eight hands long, it propels itself using turtle-like flippers that are rounded and enable it to stay on the surface of <a href="../Locations/Pond.html">ponds</a>, marshes etc.
	Its two front flippers are equipped with a stinger. <a href="../Items/Missile.html">Missile</a> Weapons are the weapon of choice.
	If you're in a Raft when it finds you, adios muchachos! One good thing is that killing one will net you a small feast o' muck.
