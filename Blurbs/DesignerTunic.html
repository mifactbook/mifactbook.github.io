<p>
	What no self-respecting wealthy <a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html">Jossman</a> should be without: a Designer Tunic. Hand crafted from the finest baby <a href="../Blurbs/Gator.html">Gator</a> hides and luxuriously lined with the spinnings of <a href="../Blurbs/GiantSilkSpider.html">Giant Silk Spiders</a>. This status symbol is the ultimate declaration of a Jossman's wealth and success. A tidy profit could probably be made by buying these cheap somewhere and selling them on to the <a href="../Locations/FarExotica.html">Exotica</a> in a more affluent town. You can carry up to four tunics; any more than that and they'd get crumpled by the rest of your belongings.
