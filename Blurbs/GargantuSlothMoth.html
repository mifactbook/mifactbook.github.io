<p>
	The Gargantu Sloth Moth is the <a href="../Blurbs/Mutates.html">Mutate</a> atrocity resulting from the cross of a <a href="../Blurbs/GargantuTreeSloth.html">Gargantu Tree Sloth</a> and a <a href="../Blurbs/SpladderMoth.html">Giant Spladder Moth</a>.
	Its huge, bloated body is so large that it can barely make flight, but its enormous wings are more than capable of bashing most any Ruk to mush.
	This beastie will then proceed to suck up the juices with its cobra-like proboscis.
	Even worse, you may manage to stay out of reach only to have it use its tongue to skewer you like a Ruk-cabob and drain your juices while you wriggle in pain.
	Ick.
