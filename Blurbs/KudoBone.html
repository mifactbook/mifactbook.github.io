<p>
	This queerly shaped bone couldn't come from a Creature you've met. It's about 8 hands long and as thick as your arm. The Kudo bone is twisted, gnarly, and covered with black spots about the diameter of your index finger. The Ancient Rite for making these bones is long lost. Possessing one can be dangerous - certain beings covet this item. A Kudo Bone is used in at least one of the more unusual <a href="../Blurbs/Voodoo.html">Voodoo</a> ceremonies. It can also be placed in a Temple's Treasure Room. You can carry 1.
