	<p>Skeletons are the most basic Undead. These magically animated undead creatures are created as guardians and warriors by evil Priests and powerful mages. Skeletons have no ligaments or muscles to allow movement. Instead, their bones are magically fused together by casting an Animate Dead spell. Skeletons can be formed from the remains of any Monster Race. The Skeleton's power is dictated by the strength of the monster used to create it. Skeletons have not been seen since the ancient Demigod Wars where legends say <a href="../Items/Grraggolos.html">Grraggolos</a> sealed their underground lairs forever.</p>
