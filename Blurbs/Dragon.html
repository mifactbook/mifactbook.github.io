<p>
	Before you stands the most enormous creature you could imagine - a Great Wyrm, a Dragon.
	Dragons range in size from 75 to over 200 hands in length and twice that in wingspan. Dragons require great space to live comfortably.
	They crave heat, sky and companionship. There are three known races of Dragons: Gold, Silver and the smaller Fire Drake.
	Did we forget to mention that each race has a fromidable breath weapon?
