<p>
	The long ages of evolution on Monster Island have filled nearly every niche with some kind of horrible beastie.
	Even the lowliest pools in the lowliest caves have been exploited by a number of species. One of these is the nulti-tentacled bat, the Myoctopus.
	Capable of flying you to the ceiling and dropping you on your head just as easily as dragging you beneath the surface and drowning you, this is one wet bat that you should try to avoid.
