<p>
	Okay so it's not really much of a weapon but if you are in to random acts of mischief you may enjoy this versatile little <a href="../Items/Missile.html">Missile</a> weapon. When you are attacked whilst camping you'll douse your opponent with one of these and the resultant lethargy will be so great it'll rob 'em of as many as 100 Action Points. That'll trach the lowlife to attack you during a break in your action. To make one cook up one <a href="../Blurbs/TurgidToadstool.html">Turgid Toadstool</a>, one <a href="../Blurbs/YellowLotusLeaf.html">Yellow Lotus Leaf</a> and one <a href="../Blurbs/Oil.html">Oil</a> in your <a href="../Blurbs/VoodooCauldron.html">cauldron</a>. You can carry up to six.
