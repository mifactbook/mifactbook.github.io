<p>
	When equipped, this unusual item makes a Bignose's nose look even more frightening. The charm's magical effect is to confuse a monster making a Snatch attempt on you - it decreases the chance of a successful snatch.
	Only a Bignose would wear such a ghastly charm - other races cannot even equip it. You can carry 2.
