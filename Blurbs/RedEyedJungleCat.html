<p>
	In the Jungle, you like to rumble? This cat will oblige you. But you won't be too happy with how much blood of yours gets spilled. Tough kitty litter.
	Those red eyes just hunger for blood. And you've got plenty to give. Worse, there's no Red Cross to patch you up afterwards. Triple drat.
	A <a href="../Items/Pointed.html">Pointed</a> weapon might give you a fighting chance against this racing demon.
