<p>
	Even though these <a href="../Items/Gauntlets.html">gauntlets</a> are missing a couple of fingers, they provide excellent protection (<a href="../Items/Two.html">Armor Class 2</a>) for hands, wrists and forearms. Have 'em repaired by a <a href="../Locations/FarForge.html">Forger</a> to get them up to <a href="../Items/Three.html">Armor Class 3</a>. You can carry 1 set.
