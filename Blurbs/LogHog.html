<p>
	An enormous member of the rodent clan of Monster Island, the Log Hog is a large-bellied creature with long chewing teeth, sharp digging claws, and a foul disposition.
	They prefer <a href="../Items/Jungle.html">jungle</a> terrain over anything else but will, in a pinch, take up residence in a fallen timber just about anywhere. so be careful when you take a rest by sitting on a log.
	It may be home to someone (or something) that will not appreciate the company.
