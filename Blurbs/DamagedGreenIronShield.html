<p>
	Once the envy of Elven armies, this Damaged Green Iron <a href="../Items/Defensive.html">Shield</a> is beaten and scratched and has lost some of its allure. In repaired condition, it is a great shield. As it is, it provides <a href="../Items/Two.html">Armor Class 2</a> protection. You can carry one.
