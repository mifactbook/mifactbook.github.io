<p>
	This is definitely one of the more unsightly Creatures of the island. It looks like a diseased jaguar.
	It hunts like a leopard in <a href="../Items/Swamp.html">swampy</a> terrain, utilizing its webbed paws to swim over the watery areas it can't leap over.
	Tangling with one is not the smartest thing unless you're a healthy, burly adventurer who carries a big <a href="../Items/Pointed.html">knife</a>.
