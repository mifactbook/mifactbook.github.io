<p>
	The Eight-Horn Plodder is a feral relative of the common <a href="../Blurbs/Plodder.html">Plodder</a>, commonly used as a <a href="../Blurbs/Mounts.html">mount</a>.
	The Eight-horn Plodder is not, however, suitable for a mount.
	It is more suitable as a thoracic ventilator as its full-speed rushes are designed to puncture your chest leaving eight robust-sized holes.
	If you are quick, you may be able to dodge to the side and take a few swipes at it with your weapon.
	If not, someone will be able to use you to water plants after you take a drink of water.
