<p>
	Using <a href="../Items/Whip.html">Whip</a> weapons does not seem to come naturally to most Ruks since they are easily the most difficult weapon to master and one of the toughest to find. But if you are lucky enough to reach <a href="../Items/Six.html">Level 6</a> with Whips, then the Crystal-Tipped Whip is for you. To make one, you must have 8 <a href="../Blurbs/HillCrystal.html">Hill Crystals</a> and a <a href="../Blurbs/GraspingScourge.html">Grasping Scourge</a>. Expend no less than 135 AP to imbed one Crystal in the end of each tentacle of the whip. The result is a devastating weapon that will cut and peel the flesh from your foe. You can only carry one of these.
