<p>
	Four legs, eight paws. Built into an incredibly muscular feline body. Wow! One encounter is more than enough for anyone.
	His or her mate is often nearby - ready to finish you off.
	If you insist on trying to kill one, an <a href="../Items/Edged.html">Edged</a> weapon is best employed.The Double-Pawed Cougar considers hilly and bamboo-laden terrains its turf.
	Trespassers will be clawed. And clawed. And clawed. 'Til they're fresh meat for this hungry cat.
