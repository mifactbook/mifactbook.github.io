title: Armor Notes
blurb: |
  <p>Many types of armor are found on Monster Island. You can be equipped with one of each of the five categories of armour: <a href="../Items/Body.html">Body Armor</a>, <a href="../Items/Defensive.html">Defensive Weapon</a>,
  <a href="../Items/Helmets.html">Helmet</a>, <a href="../Items/Greaves.html">Greaves</a>, and <a href="../Items/Gauntlets.html">Gauntlets</a>. To compute your Total Armor Class, add up the Armor Classes of your equipped items
  (count Body Armor thrice - it protects a large portion you your body). Add this to your Skin Toughness. In battle, the percent of damage absorbed by your armour in each round is equal to your Total Armour Class X .025.
  The maximum amount of damage absorbed per round is equal to your Total Armour Class. Example: A Total Armor Class of 10 would absorbe 25% of the damage up to a maximum of 10 damage. When your armor receives a severe blow
  it has a chance of breaking or shattering.</p>
