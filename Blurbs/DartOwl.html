	Okay, we all know that owls are pretty cool. Thy're wise, swift, and fearless of larger targets.
	The Dart Owl reminds you of an arctic owl, with its brilliant yellow eyes. But the Dart Owl is much bigger, extremely fast, and luckily, far stupider.
	This latter characteristic makes it all-around dangerous. An <a href="../Items/Edged.html">Edged</a> weapon works best against it.
