<p>
	This odd-looking, well-worn <a href="../Items/Body.html">Body Armor</a> shines in places and is dull in others. It resembles a solid patchwork of plates of silver backed by something similar to <a href="../Blurbs/BarkbruteSkin.html">Barkbrute Skin</a>. It provides <a href="../Items/Four.html">Armour Class 4</a> protection and additional protection versus certain foes. You can carry 1.
