<p>
	Like its less colorful counterpart, the Damaged Black Iron <a href="../Items/Helmets.html">Helm</a> is a worthy, though damaged, piece of armor. Its flat black finish makes it the perfect choice for those wishing to go silently in the night. A good <a href="../Locations/FarForge.html">Forger</a> could likely fix it up as good as new. It is an <a href="../Items/Two.html">Armor Class 2</a> item and you can carry 2.
