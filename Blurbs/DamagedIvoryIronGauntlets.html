<p>
	Once belonging to an ancient white knight, these Damaged Ivory Iron <a href="../Items/Gauntlets.html">Gauntlets</a> have seen more than their fair share of action. At best, they only provide <a href="../Items/Two.html">Armor Class 2</a> protection. But if you are into the "good guy - clean living" image, these might help define your personal style. You can carry only a single pair.
