<p>
	Are you a 198-pound weakling? Do all the other Monsters kick sand in your eyes at the seashore? If so, you need a good dose of Brawn Elixir. To prepare this Voodoo concoction use the MAKE order: M 66. Combine 1 <a href="../Blurbs/Lime.html">Lime</a>, 1 <a href="../Blurbs/BolotamusMuscle.html">Bolotamus Muscle</a>, and 2 <a href="../Blurbs/Oil.html">Oil</a> in your <a href="../Blurbs/VoodooCauldron.html">Voodoo Cauldron</a>. Simmer for 8 Action Points and you have one dose of Brawn Elixir. To USE/CONSUME it write: U 66. You'll drink it down to the last drop......and suddenly your haversuit will begin to feel tighter as your muscles expand and grow. Anyone can safely use this Elixir the first time. However additional uses increase the possibility of negative effects. Drink again with caution! You can carry up to 4 doses.
