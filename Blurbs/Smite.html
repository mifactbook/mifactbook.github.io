<p>
	The Smite is a large, ferocious oinker with one prominent feature - a long spear- like horn extending forward from above its nose.
	This horn runs from 16 to 20 hands long. The Smite can gut a foe before its foe can get near enough to do it harm.
	The Smite rarely ventures beyond the open terrain of Scrubland and <a href="../Items/SandPalms.html">Sand & Palms</a>, as its horn makes movement difficult, if not impossible, in denser terrain.
	It is best to fight fire with fire and battle a Smite with a <a href="../Items/Pole.html">Pole</a> weapon.
