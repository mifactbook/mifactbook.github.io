<p>
	Unbeknownst to many, <a href="../Blurbs/Dragon.html">Dragons</a> posess magical blood. When a dragon dies a strange thing happens during rigor mortis. In several places throughout a Dragon's body, its blood coagulates and then solidifies, forming a chunky substance known as Dragon Ichor. Ancient <a href="../Blurbs/Wizards.html">wizards</a> found Dragon Ichor to be a very useful and valuable substance in their experiments. Dragon Ichor can be placed in a god's Temple Treasure Room. You can carry 7 chunks of it.
