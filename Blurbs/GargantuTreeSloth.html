<p>
	This large tree-dweller likes to hang from branches in <a href="../Items/SandPalms.html">Sand & Palms</a> terrain and then drop upon unsuspecting foes.
	Be wary of its sharp, three-toed arms. You'll note that it is brown with white streaking while furiously wrestling with it.
	Its floppy eye pouches give the Gargantu Tree- Sloth a sad appearance, disguising its true mean streak.
