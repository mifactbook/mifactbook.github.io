<p>
	This ancient relic, a shiny, heavy-looking iron spike was once used to &quot;post&quot; a Gargoyle (i.e., suspend one dead on a post by driving the iron spike through its neck - pretty gruesome).
	You'll do this automatically if the opportunity should ever present itself. It's the only way to keep a Gargoyle dead. But he careful not to run into a Follower of <a href="../Items/Graggolos.html">Grraggolos</a>,
	the Gargoyle demigod, his followers will do their utmost to prevent your continued existence. This item may be deposited into any god's Temple Treasure Room. You can carry 1.
