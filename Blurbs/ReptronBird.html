<p>
	This odd-looking bird fits nowhere in the normal stream of nature. It looks like a bird but where feathers should be, it has scales.
	By rights it should not be able to fly, but it can. Since it is a small bird it should not be very dangerous, but it is.
	Due to its small size (1 hand tall) and covering of scales, the Reptron Bird is difficult to kill.
	An <a href="../Items/Edged.html">Edged</a> weapon is likely to be effective against it.
