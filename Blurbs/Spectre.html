<p>
	On of the very worst of the <a href="../Blurbs/EtherealUndead.html">Ethereal Undead</a>, the Spectre is a malevolent spirit that takes joy, and energy, from harrassing the living.
	Unlike most other of the Ethereal Undead, the Spectre can be temporarily disrupted with non-magical weapons.
	But take heart, after you leave, it will take a few moments to savor a piece of your spirit and to re-incorporate itself.
	It will then lay in wait, sometimes for centuries, for a new victim to cross its path.
