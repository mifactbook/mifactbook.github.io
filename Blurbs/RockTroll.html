title: Rock Trolls
blurb: |
  <p>Feral relatives of the Mine Trolls that labor for the <a href="../Blurbs/ZoingoMutant.html">Zoingots</a>, the Rock Trolls live in close-knit communities called Tribes. True to their reputation, they're tough fighters and only experienced Ruks stand a chance against
  their strength and power. However, they come well-equipped with unusual armor and weapons. These are often too large or too heavy for Ruks to use but occassionally, there will be a young Rock Troll that nearly fits your size. If that is the case, you are in great luck.</p>
