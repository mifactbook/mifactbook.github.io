<p>
	Here's a creature that loves to lurk in a menacing fashion in and around wet, <a href="../Items/Swamp.html">swampy</a> terrain.
	Picture a brown cow dressed as acrocodile with large teeth. It loves a good meal the two-legged kind.
	Its thick hide makes the Crocodowder seemingly impervious to most weaponry.
	However, you can try knocking its puny brain senseless with <a href="../Items/Bashing.html">Bashing</a> weapons.
	Killing one is a challenge and even if you're successful, its hide is too tough to retrieve and work into something useful.
