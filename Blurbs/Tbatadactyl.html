<p>
	This awe-inspiring creature is a relic of the Island's distant past. It ranks as the biggest bat anyone is ever likely to see.
	Its huge wings have a span of nearly 50 hands and its huge head has enormous canines just waiting to bite a big chunk out of you.
	When encountered on its home turf, this beast is a tough test for even the most experienced combat veteran.
