	The Bardiche is an iron weapon similar to a spear in length but having a pointed battle-axe mounted at the business end. It can be used to keep your enemy at a distance so he may not harm you with his shorter weapons. It is a <a href="../Items/Six.html">Damage Class 6</a> <a href="../Items/Pole.html">Pole</a> weapon. You may carry only one.
