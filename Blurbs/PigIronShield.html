<p>
	This is one massive <a href="../Items/Defensive.html">Shield</a>. Made out of more <a href="../Blurbs/IngotOfPigIron.html">ingots of PigIron</a> than you could ever expect to see in one place, this bad boy requires an enormous muscle of 500 just to lug around. Forunately, you get <a href="../Items/Nine.html">Armor Class 9</a> Protection from it, making it worth its weight in, well, PigIron. Because of its size, you can only carry one.
