<p>
	All light seems to dim and darkness takes control wherever the Flesh Eater walks.
	This minion of <a href="../Items/Shroud.html">Shroud</a> seems to draw power from the very darkness which follows it everywhere.
	It appears as a Creature 20 hands tall, 14 of which make up its head. It is covered with festering sores and pus. It can travel easily in most terrain.
	Its two legs are very powerful for climbing with its short, stubby arms providing little assistance.
