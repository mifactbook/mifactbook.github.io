	These are the nastiest, most deadly type of <a href="../Items/Missile.html">darts</a>. They are very difficult to make, which is why they usually sell for outrageous prices. Iron Darts are commonly fired from a <a href="../Blurbs/BlowPipe.html">Blow Pipe</a>, and do <a href="../Items/Seven.html">Damage Class 7</a> damage. You can carry 6.
