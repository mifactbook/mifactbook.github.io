blurb: 'The Spark Plant is an entertaining bush that has brightened up many a dreary day for traveling Monsters. It is a short, green bush whose buds seem to accumulate static elecricity from the air. When a certain level has been attained it discharges, emmiting a bright spark. Some Monsters can sit and watch a Sprk Plant for hours on end and never cease to be amazed by the display.'
