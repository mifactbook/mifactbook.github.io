<p>
	A common denizen of <a href="../Locations/LargeCave.html">Large Caves</a>, this bear likes to sleep a lot.
	Sure, it has a great growl, but what's really impressive is its mouth. The large, furry-brown jaws can open to cavernous size, displaying pointy teeth.
	Rows of 'em! This bear can absorb lots of damage and create a lot as well. Killing one nets you a mountain of tasty bear meat.
