		Now that most of the <a href="../Blurbs/Dragon.html">Dragons</a> have been cleared from the air above Zargnoth, the <a href="../Blurbs/Kwando.html">Kwando</a> Aviators have restarted their balloon shuttle service.
		First amass 500 <a href="../Blurbs/Oculars.html">Oculars</a> worth of coinage, then go 8 squares east of a <a href="../Locations/FarInn.html">Far Inn</a> near the Kunbar - Starth border and issue the new yell order: Y 3, "Air Kwando Flight Number 47 Cleared for Landing."
		A Kwando Aviator will land his balloon beside you. Upon payment of the 500 Oculars you'll be taken for a ride over the <a href="../Items/CrystalHills.html">Crystal Hills</a>. This takes 200 Action Points.
		Note: This is a one-way trip, so say goodbye to any travelling companions and stock up well for the journey, as you have no idea when or if you'll return. If you have a <a href="../Blurbs/Mount.html">mount</a>, you'll automatically abandoned it in departure square.
