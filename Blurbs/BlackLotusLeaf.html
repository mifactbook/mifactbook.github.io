<p>
	This tiny, solid black leaf is perhaps the rarest of Lotus leaves. Several recipies for very deadly <a href="../Blurbs/Voodoo.html">Voodoo</a> concoctions call for this leaf. It seems to be very many weeks before the shrub's leaves turn from black spotted to all black. When a leaf os all black you'll pick it. You can carry any number of these leaves.
