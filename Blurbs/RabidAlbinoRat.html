<p>
	White as snow with beady pink eyes, the Rabid Albino Rat is a crazed killer; crazed from living its life in the dark, with no light to see by. crazed by the insanity that permeates Scavenger Beasts from their evil origins.
	The Rabid Albino Rat can attack with its savage claws or with its jagged fangs - fangs that can infect you with a form of insane fear.
	Fear that will leave you fleeing for your life.
