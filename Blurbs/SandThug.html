<p>
	Just when you thought the dunes were safe, along comes the dreaded Sand Thug.
	Each is 3 to 4 cubic hands in size, somewhat turtle-like, and has great jumping ability.
	They hide just under the sand and leap onto your body, sinking their teeth into you flesh. They are tough to kill.
	Besides, their carcass is of no value.
