title: Mudwalkers
blurb: |
  <p>They are of the riskiest, most sneakiest sort. They pride themselves on their thieving abilities, as they are the
  best at stealing treasure from other Monsters. Sometimes they get so greedy that they end up in battles they might
  otherwise have avoided. They're keen trackers too. Their favorite terrain is the <a href="../Items/LowHills.html">Low Hills</a>, where they toss mudpies at passers-by.</p>
