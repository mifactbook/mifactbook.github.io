<p>
	Remember your momma Ruk telling you that spitting was a monsterly-like activity that indicated you enjoyed a meal? You can assume that this creature took that to heart and is telling you what a lovely meal you will be offering it.
	Worst off, its carefully controlled spit can contain hazardous substances that are as lethal as a direct blow from a <a href="../Blurbs/CarvedClub.html">Carved Club</a>.
	Best to keep on your toes, feinting left and right when you battle this creature.
	Otherwise you will end up with goop on your face and maybe, just maybe, as dinner.
