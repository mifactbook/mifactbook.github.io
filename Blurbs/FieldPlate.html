	As ever, the balance of power between the Gods is a delicate thing. When <a href="../Items/Shroud.html">Shroud</a> gifted his followers with the <a href="../Blurbs/MantleOfTheDark.html">Mantle of the Dark</a>,
	the balance was endangered. The great Magesmiths worked feverishly to develop armor that could defend the Champions of Light. <a href="../Items/Fuvah.html">Fuvah</a> noted the imbalance and aided the Magesmiths
	in their efforts to again make battle a test of the makings of a monster and not his armor. Once Silver Armor was perfected, the Magesmiths continued their research, producing several Iron variants:

	<ul style="margin-left:15px;margin-bottom:10px;">
		<li>Banded Iron Armor (441)</li>
		<li>Field Plate (442)</li>
		<li>Full Plate (443)</li>
	</ul>

	Some legends indicate that one Magesmith went too far and created the ultra-rare Holy Plate Mail (444)
