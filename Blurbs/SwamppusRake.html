	Do thoughts of Freddie cone to mind every time you shut out the lights? If so, then protect yourself with a mighty Swamppus Rake. Just ake one <a href="../Blurbs/SwamppusPaw.html">Swamppus Paw</a> and one <a href="../Blurbs/Squzskin.html">Squzskin</a>. Using a <a href="../Blurbs/Knife.html">knife</a>, spend 22 Action Points by using a MAKE order: M 51. This fits your hand like a glove - its claws are attached to the end of each finger. Since they're nearly a hand long, the claws give you a nightmarish quality that can strike fear into your opponent. A Swamppus Rake is a <a href="../Items/Pointed.html">Pointed</a> Weapon of <a href="../Items/Three.html">Damage Class 3</a>. You can carry just one.
