<p>
	An interesting <a href="../Blurbs/Voodoo.html">Voodoo</a> Elixir was first developed by Omar Kabobdebob, legendary Voodoo Master. He was annoyed with the constant interference of <a href="../Blurbs/Thermadon.html">Thermadons</a> whilst travelling in <a href="../Items/Sticks.html">Sticks</a>. His solution was to take a <a href="../Blurbs/StenchGland.html">Stench Gland</a> from a <a href="../Blurbs/Malador.html">Malador</a>, 2 <a href="../Blurbs/PurpleLotusLeaf.html">Purple Lotus leaves</a>, 3 <a href="../Blurbs/Oil.html">Oil</a>, and mix them in a <a href="../Blurbs/VoodooCauldron.html">Cauldron</a>. Just issue the MAKE order: M 85, and this takes 12 Action Points. The resulting elixir should be uncorked when venturing into an area overun with Thermadons. Issue the USE order: U 85, and you'll spread it around your arm pits and thighs (the two sweatiest areas). This will keep Thermadons away from you, permanently. You can carry 6 batches.
