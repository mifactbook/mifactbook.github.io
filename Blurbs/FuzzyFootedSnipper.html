<p>
	Padding along quietly, dogging your every footstep, it is the Fuzzy-footed Snipper.
	Six legged, with soft, furry little feet, canine-tipped jaws can put a major "bite" on your good time and make sitting around the campfire an...uncomfortable experience.
	Quick reflexes are necessary to avoid a painful snip.
