	If you've ever come across a sickeningly sweet smell while traveling in Low Hills you are probably passing by a Myrrh Dove nest.
	These birds are extremely beautiful to behold. Their feathers have a prismatic quality.
	When the sun strikes them they reflect in a variety of brilliant colors.
	Some believe the Myrrh Dove scent is hypnotic, because anyone who gazes at one for any length of time becomes overwhelmed with a sense of goodness and peace.
