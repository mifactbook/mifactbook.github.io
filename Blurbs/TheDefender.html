<p>
	The Defender is a long <a href="../Items/Daggers.html">dagger</a> nearly the size of a short sword. Defenders, also known as the Dagger of Defense, are believed to date back to the times of the Demigod wars when Monster battles were a common event. The Defender is a <a href="../Items/Five.html">Damage Class 5</a> <a href="../Items/Pointed.html">Pointed</a> Weapon. However, the unique magic in this blade increases the wielder's weapon Skill by 3 classes when The Defender is used to defend a campsite. If used to attack a creature or another monster, The Defender does not employ its special power. These powerful blades were reponsible for saving many lives during the war. To be used, The Defender must be equipped when a Monster makes camp. Most Monsters who own one are smart enough to sleep with it. Smarter monsters avoid a campsite where a Defender might be found.
