<p>
	At first glance, the Shotgun Serpent looks like your typical giant snake.
	However, its intestine is able to compress its droppings into small, hard pellets, and it is able to hold back large quantities of fart gas, which it can release at will.
	This combination of talents gives the serpent a vert powerful <a href="../Items/Missile.html">Missile</a> weapon.
	For those of you insufficiently discouraged by its gastro-intestinal system, it also has powerful jaws.
