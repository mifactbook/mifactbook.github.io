<p>
	You've already seen plenty of carcasses in all sorts of stages of decay during your travels. If you could find some very large carcasses with their hides intact, you could fashion a crude suit of Leather Armor.
	But only in <a href="../Items/Swamp.html"> Swamp</a> terrain are the carcasses' hides moist and pliable enough to be suitable. Issue the MAKE order: M 47 and you'll need 50 Action Points and a <a href="../Blurbs/Knife.html">Knife</a>.
	Your suit of somewhat comfortable leather provides <a href="../Items/Two.html">Armor Class 2</a> protection. You can have just one suit.
