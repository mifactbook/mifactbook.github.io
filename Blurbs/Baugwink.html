<p>
	The Baugwink is the larger cousin of the <a href="../Blurbs/MarshDweller.html">Marsh Dweller</a>, and we do mean larger.
	This beast stands nearly 20 feet tall..at least when it's not waist deep in the muck.
	It is equipped with enormous canine teeth and wicked, mud-dripping claws.
	If you are not careful in <a href="../Items/Swamp.html">Swamp</a> terrain, this creature may take you by surprise and pull you beneath the muck where it will wait till you die and then eat you in peace or is that pieces.
