<p>
	This snake is a blood sucker. It tries to attach itself to one of your limbs and then suck as much blood as possible before you successfully remove it.
	One good smack from a <a href="../Items/Bashing.html">club</a> will usually kill it.
	This is easy prey for you in <a href="../Items/Swamp.html">swampy</a> terrain.
