<p>
	You don't just find Black Arrowheads lying on the ground. They have to be crafted by the most skilled of craftsmen. To make one, you must be lucky enough to find an <a href="../Blurbs/IngotOfPigIron.html">Ingot of PigIron</a>. This Ingot must be taken to an armorer to be made into a razor-sharp, pitch-black arrowhead. If you find such a craftsman, issue the M 133 order. Be prepared to wait about 150 APs for the product. By the way, did we mention it is not cheap? You can carry 1.
