	This machete was made by the Ironsmiths of the tiny island of Redkor. <a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html">Jossmen</a> <a href="../Locations/FarForge.html">Forgers</a> have never been able to duplicate this skill. It's great for hacking your way through a <a href="../Items/Jungle.html">jungle</a>, even while riding a <a href="../Items/Mounts.html">Mount</a>. It's a <a href="../Items/Four.html">Damage Class 4</a> <a href="../Items/Edged.html">Edged</a> weapon. You can carry 1.
