<p>
	If you know your Trolls, then you know how important a good head of hair is. The longer the better. To keep their hair in top condition (not an easy thing to do when you've never taken a bath) they use liberal doses of Elixir Foliculata.
	As a Ruk, you can use this, too. To make one, issue the M 465 order to cook up 2 <a href="../Blurbs/FluffyHogTail.html">Fluffy Hog Tails</a>, 1 <a href="../Blurbs/SomandaDust.html">Somanda Dust</a>, and 2 <a href="../Blurbs/Oil.html">Oil</a>
	in a <a href="../Blurbs/VoodooCauldron.html">Voodoo Cauldron</a> for 18 AP. when done, you can smear it all over your head using the U 465 order (it takes 5 AP) and you will see immediate results. You can carry up to six of these.
