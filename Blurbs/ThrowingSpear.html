<p>
	Bringing down a charging enemy with a Throwing Spear is not the easiest task. You need just the right combination of strength and dexterity. Being able to launch it into the air on a straight and true path is of utmost importance. However of equal magnitude is being able to recover from this effort very quickly to grab your Primary Weapon before the enemy is upon you. Lacking either of these abilities means your adversary will be eating your liver in his stew. Anyone can EQUIP with a Throwing Spear but Vipers and Bignoses have the right combination of Muscle and dexterity to use them effectivly in combat. The Throwing Spear is a <a href="../Items/Missile.html">Missile Weapon</a> of <a href="../Items/Eight.html">Damage Class 8</a>. You can carry only one and you'll automatically try to recover it after each use.
