<p>
	This is the most trusted bird in all the world because it is charged with the most sacred of responsibilities.
	The sight of this massive Stork never fails to bring a smile to any Monster. Its large flapping wings make a soft, peaceful sound.
	Inside the Great White Stork's huge, sack-like mouth lies that wonder of wonders, a baby Monster! You admire the Stork's strength and stamina that enables it to carry such a heavy load over so long a distance.
