	Created long ago by Magesmith Kadondar, this cool blue Orb is Seeing is the perfect tool for the smart traveller. When USED, it magically peers into the two adjoining squares in each direction and lets you take a detailed look at what lies around you. If you are in areas you have never explored, this magical device can greatly increase your chances of finding dark places, creatures and other things. To USE it, issue the order U 268 and the orb of seeing will do the rest. Happy Hunting.
