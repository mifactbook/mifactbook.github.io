<p>
	This is an ancient relic <a href="../Items/Vessels.html">vessel</a>. It was made to resemble the head of <a href="../Items/VladosXi.html">Vlados Xi</a>, the Vampyre Demigod. Long ago, those who "traded" in blood found this chalice to be their most valued posession. Blood drunk from it gave the holder (if he were Vampyric) special abilities. However, few today know anything about Vampyric Lore, making the more practical use for this item being the depositiong of it in any god's Temple Treasure Room. You can carry 3.
