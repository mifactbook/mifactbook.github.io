<p>
	This viney plant is remotely related to the <a href="../Locations/KongoMongoTree.html">Kongo Mongo Tree</a>.
	It is nowhere near the size of a Kongo Mongo but is instead equipped with long, ropelike roots that extend from its lower branches to the ground.
	When an unsuspecting creature (or Ruk) gets too close, the rope-like roots will quickly and quietly wrap around its neck, cutting off the air, and hoist the prey from the ground.
	The body slowly decomposes to make excellent fertilizer.
