<p>
	Splatting a <a href="../Blurbs/WannaBee.html">Wanna Bee</a> means you can pull out its stinger, which makes a fairly good <a href="../Items/Missile.html">dart</a> for a <a href="../Blurbs/BlowPipe.html">Blow Pipe</a> (<a href="../Items/Four.html">Damage Class 4</a>). You can carry up to 6 stingers.
