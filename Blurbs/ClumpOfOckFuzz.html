	So you are a beast and a butcher. Looking at the dead Ock you find it is too small to even skin. The best you can do is cut off the small clump of Fuzz from its tail. The fuzz is soft, smells rather nice and comes in a variety of colours. You're sure you could sell it (with shame). You can carry 6.
