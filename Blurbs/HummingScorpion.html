<p>
	A larger version of the <a href="../Blurbs/ForkTailedScorpion.html">Fork-Tailed Scorpion</a>, the Humming Scorpion is 12 hands long and is equipped with a rock hard fork tail that it uses to bash its victims senseless.
	It gets its name from the odd humming sound its tail makes when it vibrates. Kill one and you can collect its <a href="../Blurbs/ScorpionTail.html">humming tail</a>.
