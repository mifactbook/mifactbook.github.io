<p>
	Okay, who's the wise guy who crossed a poisonous <a href="../Blurbs/ForkTailedScorpion.html">Fork-tailed Scorpion</a> with an ill-tempered <a href="../Blurbs/Landshark.html">Landshark</a>? This thing is one of the <a href="../Blurbs/LesserMutates.html">Lesser Mutates</a> and deserves to be destroyed.
	Problem is, it may not agree with you.
	If you push the point, it will likely become a little agitated and try to bite your face and poison your posterior.
	The best thing to do is RUN! But if you can't, make a valiant stand and do your best to defend yourself.
