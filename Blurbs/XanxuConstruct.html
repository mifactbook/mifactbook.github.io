<p>
	Carefully designed by the Sorceror Xanxu, the Xanxu Construct is a think of remarkable power. It can hoist and move stone from the ground to amazing heights. Its magical properties also are known to be attractants for the magical spirits of <a href="../Blurbs/Wizards.html">Wizards</a>, powerful beings well-versed in <a href="../Blurbs/Voodoo.html">voodoo</a> and magic. Too bad all Wizards were banished following the Demigod Wars as they could provide Ruks with some exceptional knowledge about voodoo and magic.
