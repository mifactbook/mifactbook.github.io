<p>
	Skeletons are created by the weakest of magicians and amount to little more than the re-animation of a long-dead pile of bones, A good bashing, smashing, whacking, whipping, poking or hacking will usually send the bones a-flying.
	Trouble is, they seldom stay that way for long.
	If you find yourself with a shattered Skeleton, be quick about your business as time will allow the bones to magically reknit and you will have a battle on your hands, again.
