	A <a href="../Blurbs/Mummy.html">Mummy</a> knows no fear. But if it did, an adventurer equipped and skilled with this weapon is what it's biggest fear would be. At <a href="../Items/Three.html">Damage Class 3</a>, this excellent <a href="../Items/Pole.html">Pole</a> Weapon is one well-balanced stick.
