	This is an incredibly impressive tool. Nearly 5 feet of solid Bori Wood topped with a carefully crafted iron head shaped to a fine point. It's amazing that anyone could cut the Bori Wood let alone polish it to such a smooth and shiny finish. The solid iron head seems quite functional and definitely capable of breaking hard ground or even rock into very smalI pieces. An enterprising monster might even find a way to use that sharp point to break hard monster-type heads. Such a tool would require great strength in the arms and shoulders to use effectively on rock or one's enemies. A Muscle of 210 is required to equip it. The Mining Pick is a <a href="../Items/Five.html">Damage Class 5</a> <a href="../Items/Pole.html">Pole</a> weapon. You can carry one.
