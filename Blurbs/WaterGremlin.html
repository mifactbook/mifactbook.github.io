<p>
	Water Gremlins are creatures of Magic. By all rights, their existence should be impossible. Water Gremlins are composed entirely of water and Magic.
	Vaguely snake-like in appearance, these creatures tend to inhabit isolated pools and ancient fountains.
	Their strike is extremely painful despite the fact that they are composed of water.
	Should you be unfortunate enough to encounter a Water Gremlin, there is good news and BAD news.
	The good news is that the Gremlin is confined to its pool and can not reach more than a few paces from the pool.
	The BAD news is that Gremlins can not be killed. Should you do enough damage, the magic will momentarily disperse leaving the water calm.
	But the Magic returns quickly and the Gremlin will strike again.
