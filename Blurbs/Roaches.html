	<p>Eeeeewwwww!!! What's slimey, nasty, smelly, and guaranteed to give you a bad case of the Heebie-Jeebies? Roaches. They seem to proliferate anywhere there are dead monsters. Worst of all, there are tons of different kinds from small nuisances, like the <a href="../Blurbs/CommonCaveRoach.html">Common Cave Roach</a> to giant behemoths better left unmentioned that can bite a monster in half and swallow the pieces in a single gulp. Be warned, some Roaches are never alone. Little could be worse than being hunted by a Roach Pack.</p>
