<p>
	This pair of <a href="../Items/Gauntlets.html">gauntlets</a> are coming apart. Still, they're good enough to provide <a href="../Items/One.html">Armor Class 1</a> protection, but really should be repaired by a <a href="../Locations/FarForge.html">Forger</a>. They also provide extra protection against certain foes. You can carry two pairs.
