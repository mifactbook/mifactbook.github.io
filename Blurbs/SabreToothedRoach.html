<p>
	What's big, powerful, angry and ready to puncture your skull with its over-sized canine teeth? The Sabre-Toothed Roach.
	A freak of nature, this bugger is nearly a hands in length and has giant teeth nearly two hands in length.
	Accompanied by a nasty disposition, you'll know you are in trouble when you hear its high pitched growl.
	Turn to face it and you will find a flying spawn of enraged bugdom closing in on your jugular veins.
	Move quick to avoid being pierced by this nasty bug.
