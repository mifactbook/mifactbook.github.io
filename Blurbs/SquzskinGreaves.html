<p>
	What can you have when you already have 4 <a href="Squzskin.html">Squzskins</a>, a <a href="../Blurbs/Knife.html">Knife</a> and 24 Action Points? Why, a pair of genuine Squzskin <a href="../Items/Greaves.html">Greaves</a>! These cover your legs nicely, from top to bottom and provide you with the most basic protection. To eliminate severe ankle bruises, issue the MAKE order: M 48. They provide <a href="../Items/One.html">Armor Class 1</a> protection and you may carry two pairs - one to be worn and one spare.
