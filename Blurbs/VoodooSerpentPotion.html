<p>
	If this is the least of the Black <a href="../Blurbs/Voodoo.html">Voodoo</a> potions, the others are going to be scary! To make it, you need just one <a href="../Blurbs/KudoBone.html">Kudo Bone</a>, one <a href="../Blurbs/TurgidToadstool.html">Turgid Toadstool</a>, and one snake of an appropriate species. Next, find a <a href="../Locations/Geyser.html">Geyser</a> and get out a suitable <a href="../Blurbs/VoodooCauldron.html">cauldron</a> and get to brewing up the mix in a base of one <a href="../Blurbs/Oil.html">oil</a>. When the green vapor starts to rise, pour the mixture down the snake's gullet and step back (waaaaaayy baaaaaaack) and watch the contortions and gyrations. When complete, the snake you had brought will become the serpent you have wrought. It will hide in the vicinity of the geyser and when it detects the puny worshippers of <a href="../Items/Kadar.html">Kadar the Meek</a>, it will attack with horrible power. If killed, your Black Voodoo will bring it back for another day.
