<p>
	Denizens of the deepest, muckiest <a href="../Items/Swamp.html">swampland</a>, the Swamp Rat is a vile and repugnant creature that slinks around in the muck nd slime, waiting for hapless prey to get stuck or just to give up hope.
	Whatever you do, don't let this creature catch you at a bad moment as it will claw and scratch and bite its way through even the toughest armour and start taking pieces out of your slightly more tender hide.
