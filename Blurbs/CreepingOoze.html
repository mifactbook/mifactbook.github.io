<p>
	Witness the Creeping Ooze, cousin of the inocuous <a href="../Blurbs/DuneOoze.html">Dune Ooze</a>.
	It lives its wretched life in the dark, creeping from one place to another, then creeping back to where it started.
	An eternity spent mindlessly creeping has led this creature to have more than a little ill will for those that do not creep - even for its fellow Scavenger Beasts.
	If you happen to interrupt its creeping ways, it will attack with all the creeping vengence it can muster. And that is not a welcome sight.
