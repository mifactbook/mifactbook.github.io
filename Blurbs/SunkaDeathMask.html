<p>
	This heavy, dark gray (almost black) ancient relic is made from some unknown material - a composite of metal and fibre. Dried red blotches (probably blood) adds to its dangerous feel. The mask has large holes for your eyes, nose and mouth, and straps that allow you to fit it securely on to your head. Although it's used in a Black <a href="../Blurbs/Voodoo.html">Voodoo</a> Rite, any God would also find it a welcome addition to his Temple's Treasure Room. You can carry 1.
