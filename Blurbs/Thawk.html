<p>
	The Thawk soars the skies of non-jungle terrains, always looking, looking, looking.
	Named after its loud, distinctive call, and resemblance to a hawk, this large navy blue avian is quite the aggressive pest.
	It preys on the smaller Creatures, but not exclusively.
	It's been known to remove a finger, hand, or eye from a Monster caught off-guard (perhaps Jazzercizing?).
	Of special note is that Thawks get along quite well with <a href="../Blurbs/Loggerhead.html">Loggerheads</a>.
