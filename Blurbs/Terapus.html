<p>
	A denizen of hilly terrain is the living menace, a Terapus.
	Standing 20-24 hands tall, this dinosaur-like Creature sprouts two heads from its short neck. Its plump body rides atop 14 legs.
	If this Creature didn't have a brain the size of a pea, it would rule the hills. Still, it comes close to doing so.
	This is definitely one of those Creatures that all but the very experienced Monsters should run from.
