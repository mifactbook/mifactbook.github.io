<p>
	One of the more sedate versions of Black <a href="../Blurbs/Voodoo.html">Voodoo</a>, Retching Poison is prepared by those who only wish ill health on everybody in the area. To make it you must combine 2 Retch Glands, 1 <a href="../Blurbs/BlackLotusLeaf.html">Black Lotus Leaf</a> and 2 <a href="../Blurbs/Oil.html">Oil</a> in a <a href="../Blurbs/VoodooCauldron.html">Voodoo Cauldron</a>. Boil it for 22 Action Points and store the mixture in a <a href="../Blurbs/FrogBladder.html">Frog Bladder</a>. When you wish to use one, issue the U 462 order when in the square with a <a href="../Locations/Waterhole.html">Water Hole</a>. Anyone drinking from that waterhole will be in for an unpleasant surprise at the end of their travels. You can carry up to 4 Retching Poisons.
