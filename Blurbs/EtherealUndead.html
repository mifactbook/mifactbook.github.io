		Ethereal Undead are powerful Undead that haunt the most desolate and deserted places. They hate all life and light. Most appear as semitransparent beings and are often mistaken for smoke or mist. These creatures exist primarily on the Plane of Shadow and can only be harmed by magical weapons.
		They are especially suceptible to Ethereal Weapons. The touch of the most powerful of Ethereal Undead has been known to drain strength from even the hardiest of Monsters. Although they haven't been seen since the disappearance of the Demigods, old ones still tell tales of the many types of this foul creature.
