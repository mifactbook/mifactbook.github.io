	<p>As a Ruk, your brains are good for two things: fighting and...drat. You can't remember the second thing. The point is, when it comes to feats of great memory, you'd rather be out whacking <a href="../Blurbs/Cheesmo.html">Cheesmos</a>. The fact is that, over time, you forget a lot of things you used to know, like, where you've been and where you've gotten spells. Well now you are in luck. By issuing the LIST TEMPLES order, you will ait down and wrack your brains to come up with the locations and structure numbers of all the temples you've visited. Better yet, it won't cost you any Actiong Points to do it. Just issue the order LT and you'll work out the details.</p>
