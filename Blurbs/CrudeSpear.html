<p>
	Because it is both a Primary Weapon and great for hunting, the Crude Spear is one of the most useful weapons around. To make a Crude Spear, issue the MAKE order: M 3. You need to be in <a href="../Items/Sticks.html">Sticks</a> terrain and spend 30 Action Points searching for a bamboo pole of the correct length, balance and sharpness. A Crude Spear is a <a href="../Items/Pole.html">Pole</a> weapon of <a href="../Items/Two.html">Damage Class 2</a>. Only one may be carried.
