blurb: 'The Shingle tree grows wild in the Jungle. It is rather rare and difficult to find. Its bark resembles layers of shingles rising up the trunk. Few branches can be found on the trunk. Only at the top is a cluster of leaf-covered branches. From time to time a giant shingle acorn will drop to the ground'
