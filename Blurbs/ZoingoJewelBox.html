<p>
	Made by the finest of the <a href="../Blurbs/ZoingoMutant.html">Zoingot</a> craftsmen, the Zoingo Jewel Box is a work of art protected by magic. It is roughly egg-shaped and iridesces with blues, greens, and reds when you hold it in the sunlight. But strangest of all, it doesn't seem to have any way of opening it. No lid, no keyhole, no hinges, no nothing. It is by magic. To open it, you either need training from a Mage, or a little brute force (just don't expect much to be left when you are done). You can carry up to four (if you have the will power).
