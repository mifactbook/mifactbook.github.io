<p>
	Ever get the feeling that something is watching you? This ravenous Creature looks so much like a bush that you're unlikely to realize you're in danger until battle is already joined.
	The Cemetery Creeper has to be <a href="../Blurbs/Wrestling.html">Wrestled</a> - you need to be quite talented at wrestling to finish it off.
	If you fail, a Cemetery Creeper is often joined by several of his close relatives - forcing your retreat.
