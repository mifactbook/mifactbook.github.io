<p>
	The most common adornment for Trolls is the simple Brass Ring. Neither beautiful nor craftily made, it is a sign of kinship for all trolls of all races. If you manage to kill a troll, which is unlikely, you may come into posession of one. Given the bad history between many troll species and <a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html">Jossmen</a>, you can usually collect a bounty at the local <a href="../Locations/FarInn.html">Far Inn</a> for each Brass Ring you have.
