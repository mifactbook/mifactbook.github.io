<p>
	The Lime Tree is a short, leafy tree bearing a bitter fruit called a Lime. It's nearly inedible in its raw form. Brighter Monsters are able to spot this tree in Sand &amp; Palms terrain and harvest up to a dozen of its fruit. Oh, if you want to feign deliriousness to nearby Monsters, issue this new YELL: Y 26.
