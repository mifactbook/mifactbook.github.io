		<p>
			When <a href="../Blurbs/TempleRuin.html">Temple Ruins</a> are completely rebuilt, the structure becomes an Unsanctified Temple. To sanctify a temple to your god, you must be of the rank of acolyte (or greater).
			Gather at least six fellow followers of you god to the square having the temple. Issue the CEREMONY OF SANCTIFICATION order: CS. This lasts for 8 Action Points. If successful, your god will make the temple His, and reward the followers present.
			The sanctification can fail for two reasons: A follower of another God is present in the square, or your god already has a temple nearby.
