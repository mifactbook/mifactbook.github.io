	This unusually curved weapon appears to be made from the rare bronze metal. You haven't seen much bronze since arriving on the Island. The blade is very wide and is shaped like a crescent moon. The unusual shape seems to compliment the heavy weight. Although it may be the most unusual weapon you have come across yet, it's a weapon designed to chop ones enemies into bite-sized pieces. The Bronze Scimitar is a <a href="../Items/Five.html">Damage Class 5</a> <a href="../Items/Edged.html">Edged</a> Weapon. The extreme weight of this rare metal requires a Muscle of 125 to equip. You can carry 1.
