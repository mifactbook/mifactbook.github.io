<p>
	A thing of some miner's nightmare, the Rock Mole is 8 hands of pure digging power.
	It comes equipped with hand-long digging claws capable of ripping apart any Ruk that should get in its way.
	It lives deep within the bowels of the earth and spends its time burrowing through solid stone in search of food and minerals.
	If you should ever run across one, try to keep your distance unless you want to get ripped to shreads.
