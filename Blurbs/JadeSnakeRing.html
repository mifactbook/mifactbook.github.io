<p>
	The ring jewelers of Wascodobellia are quite fond of jade and have made numerous rings from this handsome rock. This one has a carving of a two-headed pit viper. Some of them have found their way to Monster Island and are sought by many <a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html">Jossman</a> <a href="../Locations/FarInn.html">Innkeepers</a>. This ring does not have any special powers but Followers of <a href="../Items/Yasmin.html">Yasmin El Boa</a>, the snake demigoddess, claim otherwise. You can carry any number of rings but can be equipped with just one.
