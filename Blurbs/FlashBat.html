<p>
	Often found in caves, <a href="../Locations/LargeCave.html">large</a> and <a href="../Locations/SmallCave.html">small</a>, the Flash Bat can temporarily blind its opponent by burping up a gas from its stomach that instantly ignites with the air.
	Immediately after the burpflash, the Flash Bat tries to bite with its pointed teeth and slash with the claw points from each of its wings.
	Should you kill one, its meat is quite flavorful.
