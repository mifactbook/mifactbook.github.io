<p>
	When delving into the coffins of a <a href="../Locations/TombOfMumi.html">Tomb of Mumi</a>, you can collect some Dust of the Entombed from the oldest coffins. This dust has several uses. The most common use is for making the exotic substance <a href="../Blurbs/ZombieJuice.html">Zombie Juice</a>. You can carry only one kitty of the dust. To carry more would be a great health risk, as this dust has very unusual properties. A few Monsters are allergc to it - if you begin sneezing uncontrollably, you'll have to drop this item.
