	Black Balls were forged long ago by Jo'golian, the legendary Kwando Magesmith. They're a curious treasure. About an 1/8 of a hand in diameter, each is perfectly spherical and very heavy. When two are placed together, they sort of stick to each other and are difficult to pull apart. You can carry 6.
