<p>
	This rabid denizen of <a href="../Items/Shroud.html">Shroud</a> is a massive wolf with oversized fangs, huge clawed paws, and a massive black fur coat that hides its true size and shape as it stalks you from the shadows.
	A silver weapon is almost a necessity to kill this beast.
	Just be careful of its bite as its huge teeth and aweful jaws can put a significant hurting on even an experienced Ruk.
