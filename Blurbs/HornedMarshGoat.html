<p>
	In <a href="../Items/Swamp.html">swampy</a> terrain it is not uncommon to come across a pair of these Creatures butting heads playfully.
	This bloated-looking goat is forever chomping reeds and anything else that looks alive.
	This is an indifferent Creature; you don't bother it and it don't bother you. It's got a brown, grainy, thick skin.
	Tufts of white hair mark its legs distinctively. <a href="../Items/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> favours this creature.
