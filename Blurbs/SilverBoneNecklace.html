<p>
	This magical necklace is composed of small, bone-shaped pieces of silver linked tightly together. Whatever Magesmith made this had real talent. Worn as an amulet, it provides noticable protection against undead and vampyric foes. It can also be placed in any god's Temple Treasure room. You can carry 3.
