title: Bignoses
blurb: |
  <p>Because they are fairly ugly and above average in size, Bignoses think they are the <i>best</i>. And who's to argue?
  After all, they do seem to be superior at battle, particularly in <a href="../Items/Sticks.html">Sticks</a> terrain.
  They're also quite adept at building muscle. Their prominent proboscises assist them in finding exotic-smelling things and places.
  The downside? They have a hard time noticing <a href="../Blurbs/TarPouch.html">trapped pits</a>, <a href="../Locations/DeepPit.html">holes</a>, and the like.</p>
