<p>
	A talented Magician can take a sun-bleached pile of bones and, with the proper incantation, can turn it into a killing fury capable of causing the demise of unsuspecting travellers.
	A cautious Ruk should have little trouble disassembling this pile of bones but more than a couple can get to be exhausting, given that they seldom stay disassembled for long.
	They also come equipped with a <a href="../Blurbs/BlackIronHelm.html">Black Iron Helm</a>, a memory of their former life.
	If you can take one down, you can collect this as booty.
