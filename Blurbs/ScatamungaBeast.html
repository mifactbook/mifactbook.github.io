<p>
	You like nasty teeth? In a large mouth? Attached to something like a grizzy bear? With the fierceness and temprament of a rhino? Then meet the Scatamunga Beast! If you like limbs ripped from your body.
	If you want your life ended abruptly.
	Watch out in <a href="../Items/LowHills.html">hilly</a> and <a href="../Items/Jungle.html">jungle</a> areas, and keep a <a href="../Items/Pole.html">Pole</a> weapon handy.
