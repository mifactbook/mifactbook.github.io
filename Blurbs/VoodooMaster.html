	<p>Who's the most knowledgable mortal you are likely to meet? It's got to be the <a href="../Blurbs/ZoingoMutant.html">Zoingot</a> Voodoo Master. Legend tells that they are centuries old and are kept alive by rare Black Voodoo Rituals whose knowledge is not for sale except to rare individuals. Still, Voodoo Masters have got to eat so they are not averse to teaching dumb Ruks an easy thing of two about Voodoo. Just beware that you use the knowledge carefully as it is possible to get yourself into BIG trouble with Voodoo.</p>
