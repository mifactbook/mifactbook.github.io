<p>
	If you think you've practiced hard at your <a href="../Blurbs/Wrestling.html">wrestling</a> manoeuvers, just wait till you get a head butt from the creature that invented the head butt.
	Millions of years of intraspecies combat has rendered this creature's skull to be nearly solid bone.Granted, that makes it more than just a little short on brains but then, so are you.
