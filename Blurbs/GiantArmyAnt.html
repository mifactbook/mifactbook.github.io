<p>
	Life is NOT fair.
	All this time on the Island, Jazzercising like a dog every day to build up muscle, and for what??? Just so you can meet a bug that has more muscle than you do? What a brute! Its bad enough that this Ant is nearly 7 Hands long, but it looks like it spends the day lifting weights and doing push-ups.
	You hope to doesn't know about the smaller cousin you squished and ate earlier today.
	Giant Army Ants live only in <a href="../Items/HighJungle.html">High Jungle</a> or its remains.
	They are usually found in the middle or high canopy levels. These are bad bubbas.
	Run or at least use a <a href="../Items/Pole.html">Pole</a> Class weapon to push them off the tree.
