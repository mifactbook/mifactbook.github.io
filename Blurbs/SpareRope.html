<p>
	This is identical to the <a href="../Blurbs/JuteRope.html">Jute Rope</a> which you automatically collect from Jute Vines in <a href="../Items/Swamp.html">Swamp</a> terrain. It is an essential piece of equipment if you wish to enter <a href="../Items/HighJungle.html">High Jungle</a> terrain. It's also of help when you fall into <a href="../Locations/Quicksand.html">quicksand</a>. Plus there's a bunch more ways it can be useful. You'll collect a Spare Rope when you've reached a certain level of Muscleness. You can carry just one Spare Rope.
