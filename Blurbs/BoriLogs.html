<p>
	The <a href="../Blurbs/BoriTree.html">Bori palm tree</a> is found only in <a href="../Items/SandPalms.html">Sand & Palms</a> terrain. They are round, very straight, and sturdy. Downed ones, called Bori Logs (usually knocked down from storms) can be found floating along the coast or washed up along the beach. These logs are quite heavy; you need at least Muscle of 120 to move one.
