<p>
	This monkey-like, screechy Creature jumps from palm tree to palm tree in a neverending quest for food and frolic.
	It attacks when very hungry or if it finds seriously injured prey. Its sharp teeth can take a chunk out of you if you aren't careful.
	The small Munknut inhabits the costal regions.
