<p>
	This is the fattest Creature of the land. These tubs of lard are round and roll from square to square, trampling anything in their way.
	There's no easy way to kill them.
	No one knows what eventually happens to them - perhaps they ultimately roll off a cliff or drown? A <a href="../Items/Bashing.html">Bashing</a> weapon would be superior against it as its fat seems nearly impenetrable.
	They're found in most terrains except hills and swamps.
