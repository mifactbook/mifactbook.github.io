<p>
	This giant wolly creature is an expert at earth moving.
	It comes equipped with a pair of broad, flat horns that, when it lowers its head, can be used to push large mounds of earth all over the place.
	Why it chooses to do this is a question that has puzzled scholars and scientists for many an age.
	In fact, <a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html">Jossmen</a> often say the reason there are so few scholars and scientists around is that they stood pontificating on the benefits of Buffalozers and got to be very annoying to the Buffalozers.
	The result was the scholars and scientists got buried beneath piles of dirt. A good lesson for all Ruks to learn.
