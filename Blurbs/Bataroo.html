<p>
	Imagine a bat with huge, powerful legs and nearly vestigial wings.
	What's that? There is one right in front of you? Well, you are in great trouble, er, luck. This odd beast is the only known bat to lay its own eggs.
	Even more bizzare, this species hates to sit on its nest and has developed its own battery supply.
