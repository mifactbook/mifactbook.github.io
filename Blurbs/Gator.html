<p>
	The Gators on the island are not the same size as the ones found in the muck of Louisiana. Oh, no. These suckers are Really Big.
	They are commonly found lurking in wet terrain, a danger to all passers-by.
	The likely weapon of choice against a Gator would be a <a href="../Items/Pole.html">Pole</a> type weapon, such as a spear.
