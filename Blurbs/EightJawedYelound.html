<p>
	Another of the nasty <a href="../Blurbs/Mutates.html">Mutates</a>, the Eight-jawed Yelound is some sort of twisted <a href="../Blurbs/Hilldog.html">Hilldog</a> product that comes equipped with no less than 8 mouths on a single head! Each mouth is more than happy to take a bite out of you.
	Worse yet, if it ever gets to yelping, its eight mouths can make a terrific racket.
	Best to slice off its head before it begins as the noise is likely to attract the rest of its pack. Then you've got REAL trouble.
