<p>
	This medium-sized reptile is serious trouble for even an experienced Ruk.
	It may not be as big as a <a href="../Blurbs/Mondoconda.html">Mondoconda</a> but its jaws are loaded with savage, flesh-ripping teeth.
	It's muzzle bulges with rippling muscles with the power to bite through all but the toughest armor.
	Add to that that these beasts usually occur in large packs and you have a deadly combination of power and overwhelming numbers that can end the career of most any explorer.
