<p>
	Are you tired of taking unnecessary blows in combat? Would you like to take less damage? Then make yourself a Crab Buckler! This small, brown shield can be carried as a defensive weapon of <a href="../Items/One.html">Armor Class 1</a>. To make it, issue the MAKE order: M 102. It takes 14 Action Points and you need 8 <a href="../Blurbs/CrabExoscale.html">Crab Exoscales</a>. You can carry just one.
