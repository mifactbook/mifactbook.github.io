<p>
	This small, beautifully hand-carved statuette feels wonderful to hold (if you're a <a href="../Items/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> Follower). The maker had extraordinary skill and has rendered Kabuki's likeness in a startlingly apt manner.
	The statue is made from a Klinwood and polished or lacquered in some way that its surface is both very hard and somewhat shiny (almost glowing). This statue has one proper place: a <a href="../Items/Kabuki.html">Kabuki Temple</a>
	Treasure Room. In fact, it's very important for a Kabuki Temple to have one of these statues. You can carry 1.
