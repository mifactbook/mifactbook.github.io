<p>
	<a href="../Blurbs/ShinglePoison.html">Shingle Poison</a> is nice but it doesn't tend to last very long, thereby minimizing your potential for really doing some consistent damage. Fortunately, there are better ways of attacking your foe. One of the better ones is Black Lotus Tar. To make it, you must combine six <a href="../Blurbs/BlackLotusLeaf.html">Black Lotus Leaves</a>, one <a href="../Blurbs/TarSac.html">Tar Sac</a>, and a <a href="../Blurbs/SomandaDust.html">Somanda Dust</a> in a suitable <a href="../Blurbs/VoodooCauldron.html">cauldron</a> with 4 <a href="../Blurbs/Oil.html">oil</a> and cook it for 65 AP. When done, you will have a nasty black tar-like substance that, when smeared on a weapon, will result in greater damage. It will last about three months and is effective against creatures and monsters. To equip it you must issue the U 460 Order. You cannot un-equip Black Lotus Tar from a weapon but you can add it to any weapon you may equip. Staying dormant will not extend the life of you Black Lotus Tar.
