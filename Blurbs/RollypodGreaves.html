	<a href="../Items/SquzskinGreaves.html">Squzskin Greaves</a> just not cutting it for you anymore? Finding your legs getting whacked by foes and fallen logs? Take heart. You've come upon a great idea! Rolly-Plate Greaves. And best of all, they are a snap to make. Just take 10 <a href="../Items/RollypodPlate.html">Rolly Plates</a> and attach them to your Squzskin Greaves. The unusual texture of the Plates seems to automatically attach them with no other supplies needed. Too cool. When done you will have <a href="../Items/Two.html">Class 2 Protection</a> for your <a href="../Items/Greaves.html">legs</a>. You can carry two sets of Rolly-Plate Greaves and it will cost you 35 Action Points to make them.
