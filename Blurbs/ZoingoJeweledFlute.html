<p>
	Two hands long and made of solid gold, this flute was made by the finest <a href="../Blurbs/ZoingoMutant.html">Zoingot</a> craftsmen who labored many hours to inlay a variety of jewels, including <a href="../Blurbs/SlinkBauble.html">slink baubles</a>, <a href="../Blurbs/RedBauble.html">red baubles</a>, and diamonds into its metal. It looks like it would make beautiful music except it is so petite that your fat fingers could never play it properly. still, with all that gold and jewels, someone is likely to pay well for this little beauty. You can carry up to six.
