<p>
	This deadly bat is nearly 15 hands tall with a huge bony head that's been fused into a knife-sharp, axe-shaped monstrocuty of death and dismemberment.
	All the structureal changes have resulted in a surprisingly small mouth so when it searches for prey, it likes to chop them up into very, very small bite-sized chunks.
	If you happen to be prey, you're about to find out what <a href="../Blurbs/Cheesmo.html">Cheesmo</a> McNuggets feel like right before getting nuggetized.
