<p>
	Lo Dobian was the Seventh Lavodorian King. To give his Royal Guard a special edge, he had his Magesmiths construct a wonderful new shield. The Iron Spike protruding from its centre gives the shield a fearsome look to it. Constructed from a blending of Iron, gold and kashart, the shields are believed to be unbreakable. Of course they are quite heavy (you need a Muscle of 200 to Equip it). The <a href="../Items/Defensive.html">Shield</a> provides <a href="../Items/Seven.html">Armour Class 7</a> protection. In addition, sometimes the spike will cause extra damage to a foe. You can carry 1.
