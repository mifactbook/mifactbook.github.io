<p>
	Imagine a cross between a giant kangaroo and a monstrous gorilla and you can imagine the Congorilla.
	This creature is an over-muscled bundle of bouncing fur.
	In a fight, it can take you out by thumping your head with its huge feet or it can crush you with an overwhelming gorilla hug.
	Best to steer clear of this beastie if you wish to live another day.
