<p>
	This dog thinks it owns the <a href="../Items/LowHills.html">hills</a>.
	It barks incessantly at times - you'll sleep very poorly if you camp in a square where Hilldogs abound.
	The Hilldog has a nasty bite but otherwise isn't too tough. It is easy to spot, being white with a few blackish-gray splotches.
	It's almost as big and cute as a St Bernard.
