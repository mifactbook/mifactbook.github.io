<p>
	You've probably seen the much smaller cousin of this creature inhabiting many of the <a href="../Locations/TombOfMumi.html">Tombs</a> and <a href="../Locations/AncientGraveyard.html">Graveyards</a> of the island, but never reaching the gigantic proportions of this creature.Standing erect at 12 hands tall, this arachnid is out for your blood, and it has the strength to get it.
	Its fangs are drooling at the prospect of an early lunch. Also, watch out for the sticky gunge oozing from its glands, it's bound to be harmful.
	A <a href="../Items/Pole.html">pole</a> weapon would be the best method of attack.
