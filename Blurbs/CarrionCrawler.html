<p>
	If you've been perceptive, you've likely noticed that there are a lot of creatures killed on Monster Island, along with the occassional Ruk.
	Yet, in all your lengthy travels, you've never yet run across the rotting carcass of a <a href="../Blurbs/SpringSpider.html">Spring Spider</a> or a <a href="../Blurbs/Tusker.html">Tusker</a>.
	Why? Well, it is the handiwork of the Carrion Crawler, one of the Scavenger Beasts. It inhabits the night, consuming dead flesh.
	But this creature also inhabits the darkest of dark places where carrion is rare.
	In this case, they will not hesitate to consume living flesh, including Ruks.
	So beware if you visit such places because being killed by this creature will ensure that no one will ever find you rotting body.
