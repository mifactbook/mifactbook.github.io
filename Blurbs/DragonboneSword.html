<p>
	This magical, fantastic great sword feels light and nimble, but packs a tremendous wallop. Swish! It's solid <a href="../Blurbs/Dragonbone.html">Dragonbone</a>, which is off white in colour, and features a black, leather-wrapped hilt. The Dragonbone Sword is a <a href="../Items/Five.html">Damage Class 5</a> <a href="../Items/Edged.html">Edged</a> weapon. What's even better is that in battle it's like fighting with two extra Skill Levels in Edged Weapons, but only if it happens to be the weapon you're equipped with when going into battle. To equip it you must have at least 110 Muscle. You can carry 1.
