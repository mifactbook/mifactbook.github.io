<p>
	So, you've decided to try raising the dead. Issue the MAKE order: M 67 and into your <a href="../Blurbs/VoodooCauldron.html">Voodoo Cauldron</a> place 1 <a href="../Blurbs/DustOfTheEntombed.html">Dust of the Entombed</a>, 1 <a href="../Blurbs/WhiteLotusLeaf.html">White Lotus Leaf</a>, 1 <a href="../Blurbs/TholomiteHeart.html">Tholomite Heart</a> and 4 <a href="../Blurbs/Oil.html">Oil</a>. This takes 8 Action Points and makes one batch of Zombie Juice. To use it, move to a square having an <a href="../Locations/AncientGraveyard.html">Ancient Graveyard</a>. If you've some type of <a href="../Items/Digging.html">digging implement</a> you can issue the USE/CONSUME order: U 67. You'll exhume a corpse and apply an entire batch to its skin. In 4 Action Points, the corpse will begin to move. You've created a <a href="../Blurbs/Zombie.html">Zombie</a>! It will follow (but not fight for you) until you issue the RELEASE CREATURE order: RC. It will then guard that square - attacking those who are not of you race/group who enter the square. You can carry 4 batches.
