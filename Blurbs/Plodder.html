<p>
	This is the most common Mount on the island due to its friendliness, low hunger (just 2 Food per turn), and relative easiness to train.
	Resembling a small zebra with fat, stubby legs, its vivid brown and red striping makes it easy to spot - which is quite handy for his owner.
	It moves slow 'n steady through most terrains, climbing and descending <a href="../Items/HighHills.html">High Hills</a> without hesitation.
	The Plodder is quiet, gentle and loyal. Although it has no offensive capability in battle, it's not a hindrance either.
	Some Creatures will be more reluctant to fight you when you ride this dependable Mount. Hey, it even responds to giddy-ups.
