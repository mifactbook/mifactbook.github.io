<p>
	If you hear the sound of skittering feet behind you in the darkest of dark places, pray to your god that it is not the aweful Feeder Crab.
	This denizen of the dark lives in large colonies; their pale carapaces emitting a pale luminescence when they attack, they attack in packs and use their claws and legs to pull you apart and devour your flesh.
	Not a pleasant way to go.
