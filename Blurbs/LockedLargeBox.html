	Over a hundred years ago, the amazing Nedr crafted his impregnable boxes. These boxes are the choice of merchants, travellers and royalty for keeping valuable objects from falling into the wrong hands. Only special keys can open the boxes. Nedr was so clever that no one since his time has been able to craft boxes a tenth as good. Should you ever find yourself in the Kwandonian Kagliarchy, be sure to visit the monument erected in his honour. You can carry 1.
