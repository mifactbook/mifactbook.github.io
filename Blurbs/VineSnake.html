<p>
	Monster Island is wild about snakes. The Vine Snake is just another in a long-line of fanged and venomous reptiles.
	This one bears an uncanny resemblance to a large woody vine. Many are 20 to 30 hands long and only a hand around.
	Their long skinny shape lets them mimic vines and wait patiently for prey to walk by. If you are unlucky, you may be that prey.
