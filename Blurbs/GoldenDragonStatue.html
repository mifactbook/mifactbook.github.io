<p>
	This smallish, shiney statuette depicts a two-headed <a href="../Blurbs/Dragon.html">Dragon</a> in a battle stance. Imagining that such a Dragon ever existed is very disturbing to you - you can't fathom how anyone or anything could have defeated such a tremendous monstrosity. This may be the largest gold item you'll ever see. It would make a tremendous addition to any god's Temple Treasure Room - and it is not something a god would ever let go of easily. You can carry 1.
