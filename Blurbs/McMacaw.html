<p>
	Bright and multi-colored, this bird resembles a very large parrot...with a stuttering problem.
	Unfortunately its pleasing appearance hardly compensates for its loud, annoying gibb-gibb-erish.
	Squaawk! To correct this, a well-timed whack with a <a href="DriftClub.html">Driftclub</a> will quiet it permanently.
	The McMacaw is found somewhere near the coast because its favorite food is sligg turtle eggs.
