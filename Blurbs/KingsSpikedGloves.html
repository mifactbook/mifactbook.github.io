<p>
	Many, many years ago, Kro Tar, the Ninth Lavodorian King, had his Magesmiths make a wonderful pair of <a href="../Items/Gauntlets.html">Gauntlets</a> for his Royal Guard (which is believed to have numbered 200). Three small iron spikes stick out between the knuckes and the wrist, giving the gloves a dangerous look. Made from a blending of iron, gold and Kashart, the Gauntlets may be the best ever made. They provide <a href="../Items/Four.html">Armour Class 4</a> protection. In addition, sometimes your spikes will cause additional damage to a foe, especially when <a href="../Blurbs/Wrestling.html">wrestling</a>. You can carry one pair.
