<p>
	On first sight, you'll know you have witnessed something special. Few ever see a Dragonhorse as it only inhabits a select few dark places.
	It will seldom battle you as it is far too cunning to let you lay a weapon on its purple-hued flanks.
	But if you are an exceptional rider with at least a Riding Skill of 175, you may be able to capture and train it as a Mount.
	If you are so lucky, you will have the finest Mount ever made.
	Just be aware that Jossmen hold a natural fear of this beast as legend tells that Doom follows behind the rider of a Dragonhorse.
	Expect them to charge extra for stabling.
