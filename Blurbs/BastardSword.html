<p>
	This sword is similar in shape to the <a href="../Blurbs/Longsword.html">Longsword</a>, but it is noticeably longer. It appears to be modeled along the lines of swords used by the Knights of the Light in their Crusades during the reign of the first Lavadorian King. Its strange the way the blade seems to catch and reflect even dim moonlight clearly. The balance of this fine weapon is incredible. Etched into the crosspiece is a detailed picture of a blazing sun. Watching the sunlight reflect off the mirror finish, one could almost imagine that this was a blade out of ancient history..... Its a nice dream. The reality is that the Bastard Sword is a <a href="../Items/Six.html">Damage Class 6</a> <a href="../Items/Edged.html">Edged</a> Weapon. Its extreme weight requires a Muscle of 255 to equip. You can carry but one.
