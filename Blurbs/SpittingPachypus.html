<p>
	Aimlessly wandering, minding your own business and, suddenly THWACK! A big wet one smacks you right upside the head. What a revoltin' development.
	Yoou've come face to face with the Spitting Pachypis, a multi-humped, long ledded beast of <a href="../Items/SandPalms.html">Sand & Palms</a> terrain with an enormously bad disposition and a tendency for prolific expectorations.
	If you manage to best one in battle, be prepared to need a serious bath when you are done.
