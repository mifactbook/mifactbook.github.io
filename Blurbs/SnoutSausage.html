<p>
	Killing a <a href="../Blurbs/Snout.html">Snout</a> in battle makes a total mess of its innards. However, killing a captured one allows you to do it cleanly and this rewards you with a dozen Snout Sausages. Although Monsters find these sausages to be inedible, the <a href="../Blurbs/Plodder.html">Plodder</a>, a <a href="../Blurbs/Mounts.html">Mount</a>, just loves them. To feed one to your Plodder, write the USE order: U 104. You can carry a dozen Snout Sausages.
