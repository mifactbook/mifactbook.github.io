<p>
	Red as blood and faster than the eye can usually see, the Blood Roach is the athlete of the roach kingdom.
	It slashes and jabs, bites and nabs, then it smacks you with its hardened wings.
	If you are not lucky enough to catch it with your weapon, it'll likely beat you to a pulp then run away, leaving your pieces for something else to clean up.
