<p>
	The Military Pick is similar to the <a href="../Blurbs/MiningPick.html">Mining Pick</a>, with a few redesignes to make it more useful against living targets. The backside of the solid iron head has been sharpened to a second point. The smooth Bori Wood handle has been lengthened by adding a solid iron ball to balance the weight and provide an additional damage dealing capability. Although it could be used to break rock, it seems a terrible way to mistreat such a fine weapon. The Military Pick is massive and requires a muscle of 275 to Equip. It is a <a href="../Items/Six.html">Damage Class 6</a> <a href="../Items/Pole.html">Pole</a> weapon. You can carry one.
