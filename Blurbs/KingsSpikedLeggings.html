<p>
	Back in the reign of Jut Goddab, the tenth Lavodorian King, the Royal Guard complained about their <a href="../Items/Greaves.html">greaves</a>. They just didn't measure up to the rest of their armour. So, Jut Goddab commissioned his Magesmiths to make a set of special leggings. They succeeded. The addition of four spikelets sticking out along the front at a 45 degree angle, gives these leggings an offensive role in battle. Constructed from a blending of Iron, Gold and Kashart, the leggings are thought to be unbreakable. They provide <a href="../Items/Four.html">Armour Class 4</a> protection (as greaves). In addition, sometimes the spikelets will cause extra dmage to a foe during battle, particularly when <a href="../Blurbs/Wrestling.html">wrestling</a>. You can carry 1 pair.
