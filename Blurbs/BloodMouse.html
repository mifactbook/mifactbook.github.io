<p>
	The Blood Mouse is a rodent with a taste for flesh. It gets its name from the blood red patches of fur that line its cheeks.
	It makes it look like it's just eaten a very bloody dinner. If you get in its way, it may try to make a meal out of you, too.
	Bash, slash, or smash it to a bloody pulp if you want to battle it.
