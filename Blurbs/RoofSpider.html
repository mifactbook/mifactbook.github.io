<p>
	The giant relative of the common <a href="../Blurbs/SpringSpider.html">Spring Spider</a>, the Roof Spider is one of the evil Scavenger Beasts.
	It lies in wait with its pale, bloated body hanging from the roof of the darkest of dark places.
	When prey creeps below, it drops from its perch to wrestle it to the floor, injecting its venom and holding on till its prey collapses in pain and dies.
	It then drags the body to its roof perch where it slowly consumes it over the span of weeks.
