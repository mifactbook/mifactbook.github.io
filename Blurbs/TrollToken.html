<p>
	You are late for an appointment at the <a href="../Locations/FarExotica.html">Exotica</a> and suddenly find yourself without enough pocket change to get you and your <a href="../Blurbs/Mounts.html">mount</a> across the <a href="../Locations/TrollBridge.html">Troll Bridge</a>. It takes time to bash enough <a href="../Blurbs/Loggerhead.html">Loggerheads</a> to gather the required coinage. You miss your appointment. Drat. If you've ever run into this situation, then you will be glad to know about Troll Tokens. Just give one to the local Troll Bridge Operator and you can go on your merry way. Quite the time save. You can carry up to six.
