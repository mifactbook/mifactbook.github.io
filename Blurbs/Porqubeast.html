<p>
	What do you get when you cross a porcupine with a zebra? Yep, a Porqubeast. Yellow-striped, it still stands 14 hands tall.
	It's one of the fastest creatures on the island. However, it usually doesn't flee from predators.
	No, it likes to give its foes a brushing from its quill-covered body. Each quill is about 2 hands long and is painfully sharp.
	Fighting one is like doing battle with a living hairbrush! It's extremely obvious that a <a href="../Items/Pole.html">Pole</a> Weapon would be its nemesis.
