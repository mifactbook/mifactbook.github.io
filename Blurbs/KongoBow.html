<p>
	A Kongo Bow has only one purpose: To kill a <a href="../Blurbs/Dragon.html">Dragon</a>. When combined with a <a href="../Blurbs/BlackArrow.html">Black Arrow</a>, it can, with luck and courage, strike to the heart of even a Dragon and slay it. To make a Kongo Bow, you must chop a branch from the uppermost reaches of a <a href="../Locations/KongoMongoTree.html">Kongo Mongo Tree</a> and fashion it into a slender and powerful bow. It takes 10 <a href="../Blurbs/BowString.html">bowstrings</a> to get a proper pull. To make a Kongo Bow, issue the M 151 order in a Kongo Mongo Tree square. It takes 150 APs and 10 Bow Strings. You can carry 1.
