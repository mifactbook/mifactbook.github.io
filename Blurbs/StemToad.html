<p>
	<a href="../Items/Swamp.html">Swamp</a> squares are murky, damp, and generally unpleasant places to be. Only one thing good can usually be said of one.
	It is the home of bulky Stemtoads. These large yellow toads warble a pleasant song that helps your time in the swamp pass quicker.
	They also light up at night with a friendly, yellow glow that helps guide the way through treacherous terrain.
