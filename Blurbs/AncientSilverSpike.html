<p>
	A nasty-looking, heavy silver spike, this ancient relic has one primary use; it's to be driven into the heart of a vampyre or vampyre construct (preferably when he or she is unconscious).
	You'll do this automatically if the opportunity should ever present itself. It eradicates the vampyre (or construct) in a superlative fashion. Naturally, if you're found by a Follower of <a href="../Items/VladosXi.html">Vlados Xi</a>
	and you're carrying a Silver Spike, you won't be treated in a friendly manner (perhaps this is the understatement of the century!). This item my be deposited into any god's Temple Treasure room. You can carry 2.
