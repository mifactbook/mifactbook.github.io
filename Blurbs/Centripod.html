<p>
	Imagine a whirling disc with 100 multi-jointed legs. Now imagine each leg is tipped with cutting claws.
	Still further, imagine the central disc having 100 mouths each waiting for a piece of food. Well, now you are imagining the Centripod.
	It attacks by rotating rapidly with each of its legs alternately trying to take a piece out of you. Not a pleasant creature to meet in a tight spot.
