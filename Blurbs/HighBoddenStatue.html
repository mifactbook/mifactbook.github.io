<p>
	This crafted <a href="../Items/Talismans.html">Talisman</a> shows the true genius of the <a href="../Blurbs/Bodden.html">Bodden</a> race. Once the 13th <a href="../Items/BlackboneRing.html">Blackbone Ring</a> is placed over the three posts, the rings lock into place and the <a href="../Items/Statues.html">Statue</a> transforms from a Bodden to a High Bodden. Each High Bodden statue varies based on the individual Rings used in its construction. Yours appears to have a number of small flaws probaly due to the fact that the Bodden you killed for the rings came from many different families. A true statue formed by the Ancestor Rings of a single family would be a priceless treasure. This Talisman would be treasured by any God as an addition to his Treasure Room. Taking the rings back off the statue is a feat beyond your mental capacity. You can carry only one of these valuable items. More would probably get you killed.
