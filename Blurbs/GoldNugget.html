	Ever tried your hand at prospecting? If so, then you know the thrill of finding a nice, beautiful piece of solid gold, straight from the earth. It sets a chill through your veins when you find one. of course, since its gold, it is valuable and nearly any monster race would pay to have a Gold Nugget or two to use or just hold you can carry up to 100. Anymore than that and you'd be too rich to care.
