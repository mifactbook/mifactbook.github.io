<p>
	This is one of the famous ancient relic vessels! Crudely engraved on it are the symbols for earth, air, water and fire. When certain liquids are drunk from it, it gives great powers and amplifies some <a href="../Blurbs/Voodoo.html">voodoo</a> elixirs. This stein is sort of the equivalent of a <a href="../Blurbs/VoodooCauldron.html">Voodoo Cauldron</a>, in that it is a many purpose vessel. This item is also a welcome addition to any god's Temple Treasure Room. You can carry 3.
