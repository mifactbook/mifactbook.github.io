<p>
	Living beneath the sand is the Ripple Beast. Its name comes from the way the sand undulates as it moves beneath the surface.
	Usually you'll only see it during its attack run, when it surfaces.
	Its uppermost body resembles a flat, long sting-ray with a small mouth on the under- side.
	A "bashing claw" extends from either side of its body, and is used to bludgeon its prey to pulp before gulping down tinier pieces that "come loose."
