<p>
	Why anyone would have created a creature like the Cheezer is anybody's guess.
	It is a cross between a <a href="../Blurbs/Gator.html">Gator</a> and a <a href="../Blurbs/Cheesmo.html">Cheesmo</a> and looks like a giant rodent with a very nasty skin rash.
	Of course don't let appearances fool you.
	Once it opens its furry jaws, you will see the row of giant dagger like teeth just waiting to put the chomp on you.
	To top it off you have also got to look out for its broad tail which can break a leg if you are caught flat-footed.
