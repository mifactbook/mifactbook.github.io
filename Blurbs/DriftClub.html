	After washing ashore on this island you feel rather naked without a weapon. A piece of driftwood is floating in and out with the surf. You pick it up and find that it fits your hand rather nicely. The balance isn't to your liking and it's a bit light for a serious <a href="../Items/Bashing.html">Bashing</a> weapon but you decide to keep it until you can find something better. The Driftclub is a <a href="../Items/One.html">Damage Class 1</a> Bashing weapon and you may carry just one.
