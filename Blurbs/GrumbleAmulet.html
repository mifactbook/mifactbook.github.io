<p>
	Made from Grumbel feathers, this magical necklace is worn by elite Furrcats. True, it is one of the most beautiful <a href="../Items/Amulets.html">Amulets</a>, and this may be why Furrcats are percieved to be the coolest of the Seven Monster Races. The Amulet's power manifests whilst a Furrcat is hunting; success is more frequent. Naturally, only a Furrcat knows how to use this properly - other races cannot even equip it. You can carry 2.
