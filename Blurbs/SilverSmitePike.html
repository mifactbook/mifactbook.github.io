<p>
	The Silver <a href="../Blurbs/SmitePike.html">Smite Pike</a> is a beautiful mixture of creature part and the skills of the <a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html">Jossman</a> ForgeMaster. The base of this fine weapon was long, yet sturdy horn from a mature <a href="../Blurbs/Smite.html">Smite</a>. The ForgeMaster has placed a thin, yet strong and very artistic coat of pure silver over the business end of the Pike. This coating has made the weapon more durable. As an added bonus, it will now do additional damage to those creatures vulnerable to Silver. The Silver Smite Pike is still a <a href="../Items/Four.html">Damage Class 4</a> <a href="../Items/Pole.html">Pole</a> Weapon. You can only carry one.
