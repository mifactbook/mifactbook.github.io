	What an evily, cool little charm to adorn oneself with. It's shaped as an iridescent beetle about the size of your hand. Better yet when equipped it will provide you with additional protection during battle.
	Its magical properties will actually provide <a href="../Items/Four.html">Armor Class 4</a> protection which is not bad for a Wizard. You can carry one.
