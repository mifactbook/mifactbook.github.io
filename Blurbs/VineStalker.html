<p>
	Most cleverly disguised as a large green vine, this <a href="../Items/HighJungle.html">High Jungle</a> fiend attacks all who venture near.
	It's gangly suckers are not at all pleasant to be swatted with. And it's very persistent. What to do? As the Bodden say, kill it and kill it quick- ly.
	An <a href="../Items/Edged.html">Edged</a> weapon is best.
