	<p>The salty sea surrounding the island is normally calm. Still, storms can and do blast the coast. It is best for you to be inland during a serious storm unless you would actually enjoy being swept away by a high wave. Scattered near the island are islets. Watch out for coral areas should you find or build a raft and venture into the sea. Visibility is usually excellent along the coast. A net would be handy for catching fish.</p>
