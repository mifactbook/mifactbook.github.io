<div class="info-section">
	<p>Low Hills feature a mix of palm trees, muck, sand, and mud. This terrain is most dangerous after a storm because it can become very muddy. Mud slides are not uncommon and are very dangerous to unwary Monsters. Some of the Creatures found in Low Hills are subterranean dwellers as the soil is firm enough so their burrows do not readily collapse. Visibility varies widely. Foraging here is usually pretty good. Hunting isn't always successful.</p>
