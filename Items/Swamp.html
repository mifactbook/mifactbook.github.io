	<p>
		This is the least liked and worst smelling terrain of the island. Swampy terrain includes all sorts of wet ground, such as marshes and even everglades along the coast.
		Skirmishing successfully here is very difficult, as maintaining your footing is not easy. In addition, some of the most dangerous creatures inhabit swamps.
		Short range visibility is often good, but there are no high spots to see farther distances. Foraging is hopeless while hunting isn't so hot either.
