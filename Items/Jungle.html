<div class="info-section">
	<p>This is what you would call &quot;barely navigable jungle.&quot; It is difficult to move through. Mounts become very irritable when traversing this terrain. Because visibility is poor, encounters with Creatures are fewest in Jungle terrain - or so it seems. Foraging success is sheer luck. Hunting is difficult but often enough successful. Everyone is a little more nervous and tense in Jungle. This leads to a higher frequency of encounters becoming battles.</p>
