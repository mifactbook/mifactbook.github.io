	<p>This terrain is littered with all sorts of trees, mostly palms. High Hills may be the least common terrain on the Island. It's less muddy than <a href="../Items/LowHills.html">Low Hills</a>. Visibility is excellent. Hunting and foraging are usually quite good too, making this terrain a prime spot for a building site. This terrain is really just one Big Hill.</p>
