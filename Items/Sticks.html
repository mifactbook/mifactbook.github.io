		This common terrain is somewhat flat and littered with assorted varieties of bamboo plants. Sometimes the bamboo gets so thick that moving through the square is like trying to fight your way through a tight maze.
		There are some palm trees, but too often they are lying on their sides, decaying, fallen from old age or knocked down by an unfriendly storm. In thin bamboo, you can see pretty far.
		Thick bamboo affords easy hiding places and obscures everything much farther than the end of your nose! Although Sticks terrain turns up some food when foraging, it is the hunting that makes this terrain rewarding.
