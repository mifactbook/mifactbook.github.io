	<p>Unless you can fly, and fly well, the Crystal Hill ranges are not something you're going to investigate. This terrain is mostly solid crystalline rock, all too often with very sharp edges. This makes climbing not only impractical, but extremely bloody. The starkness of the translucent gray-pink crystal clashes with the rest of the island's landscape.</p>
