<div class="info-section">
	<p>This is the Real Jungle! It is so dense that ground level is too difficult for Monsters to travel through. However, muscular Monsters equipped with a <a href="../Blurbs/JuteRope.html">Jute Rope</a> and a <a href="../Blurbs/SpareRope.html">Spare Rope</a> can enter this terrain by issuing the HIGH JUNGLE ENTRY order: HJ. It costs 4 Action Points. You must then attempt entry into a High Jungle square with your next order (T or H). This will enable you to climb up and travel through the upper level, called the canopy level. In the tree tops, visibility is close to normal, but this is still a very dangerous terrain to venture into. If you have a Mount, you'll leave it behind, and who knows if it will still be there when (if?) you return.</p>
