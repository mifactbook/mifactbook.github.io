	<p>Sand and palm trees - they're everywhere! Or so it seems. This, the most common terrain of the island, consists of lightly colored sand dotted with assorted varieties of trees (mostly palms), bushes, and similar vegetation. The screeches of the birds and animals living in this terrain are almost musical to the ear. (That is if you like New Wave music!) Visibility is quite good and, if you take the right precautions, it is probably the safest terrain to camp in. It's also the best terrain for foraging, although no better than average for hunting.</p>
