		All around you lie the ruins of a temple. It is in such a state of disrepair that you cannot even determine which god was worshipped here. If you'd like to rebuild the temple you may issue the REBUILD order: Z (Action Points). Each time you issue this order you will be told the new state of repair. Any Monster can work on rebuilding the temple. The process of rebuilding is very simple but also very time-consuming. Most of the building materials are lying about the ruins. Your job is to reassemble the stone and bamboo structure in a manner that would please the fussy gods. To speed up the repair, acquire a <a href="../Blurbs/JuteRope.html">Rope</a> and <a href="../Blurbs/Mounts.html">Mount</a> (a docile one). If you're a member of a Group, fellow Group members in the square can assist you with heavy tasks while they're camped.
