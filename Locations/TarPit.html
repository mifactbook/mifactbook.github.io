		Bigger than a <a href="../Locations/Waterhole.html">Waterhole</a>, smaller than a <a href="../Locations/Pond.html">Pond</a>, a Tar Pit is filled with a thick, sticky, and somewhat smelly black substance - tar. A Tar Pit is difficult to fall into - you'd have to be fleeing some Creature for that to happen. Of course, should you fall into one, that's it, you're dead. Keep this in mind, eh? Oh, what about those large, rodent-like foot- prints around it?
