		Sitting near the middle of the square you find a large boulder. It looks like it weighs a ton. The odd thing is that the ground is marked with a shallow furrow where the boulder apparently was rolled to its current position. Even odder is that it was moved or rolled up hill, a feat of strength difficult to imagine. If you want to try moving this boulder you'll need to locate a tree branch for use as a lever and find a small rock to act as the fulcrum. Issue the LEVERAGE BOULDER order: LB. It takes 4 Action Points to attempt.
