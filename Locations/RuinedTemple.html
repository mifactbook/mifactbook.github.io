	<p>
		You see what must have been a temple but this was a long time ago. Some of the walls have collapsed and it
		is in a very poor state of repair. There is an intensely cold chill to the air; it
		almost seems to be emanating from the ruins. No vegetation grows on the ruins which is
		odd. Looking closer you see that some creepers that have grown towards the temple have
		withered and turned black. There is a stone plaque dedicating the temple to the demigod
		<a href="../Items/VladosXi.html">Vlados Xi</a>, lord of death and the antipathies of all things living. Only a very brave
		monster would dream of searching these ruins. If you think that you are that brave and have muscle and toughness greater than 100, light a torch and venture in; it will cost
		you at the most 100 action points. Issue a U 33 to enter.
