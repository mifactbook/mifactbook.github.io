		A newly rebuilt Fort consists of a semi-secure wall and a building in its center. The largest room is the stable where two dozen Mounts can be stabled. The next largest room is the bunk room which has a dozen bunk beds.
		There is also a storage room, an outhouse (without water), and a double-room consisting of living quarters and workroom suitable for a single permanent resident. A Fort is owned/controlled by whoever occupies it.
		When occupied, other Monsters have to force their way in. They'll be subject to the Fort's traps (if any) and have to fight the occupants of the fort - except for your own Group's members.

	<h2>Fort Orders</h2>
	<p>
		To camp in a fort, issue the FORT STAY order: FS. This is excellent for recovering Health. To guard/camp in Fort, issue the GUARD FORT order: GF. This has you camp in the fort, but you'll be on guard for intruders and consequently,
		recover less Health. To make some sort of physical improvement to the fort, issue the ENHANCE FORT order: EF. This requires 16 Action Points and may result in taking one or more of your possessions and making it a permanent part of the fort.
		To place items in the store room, issue the PLACE order: P (Item#) (Qty). To remove items, issue the BRING order: B (Item#) (Qty). Note: Food cannot be placed in the store room. If the square already has your Group's Totem Markings,
		you can issue the TM order to mark the fort.
