	<h2>Jossman Town Square</h2>
	<p>Set in the middle of a cluster of far structures, you can usually find a Town Square. Sporting a fountain of pure water, it makes the ideal place to rest at meal times, where you can sit and watch the <a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html">Jossmen</a> go about their business.</p>
	<p>This is also the place where it's been rumoured that Jossmen conduct their secret ceremonies. However you're very unlikely to stumble across one as it's been said that their nostrils can smell a Ruk approaching from over a thousand hands away.</p>
