<div class="info-section">
	<p>Usually built near a <a href="../Locations/Geyser.html">Geyser</a>, a Far Forge is a fairly small stone structure. It houses a <a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html">Jossman</a> Forger and his family. Half the building consists of the forge and a storage area. In the other half lie the living quarters.</p>
	<p>Inside the forge half you are impressed by the beautiful anvil. You also see an assortment of forger's paraphernalia, but no weapons or armor. You later learn that such are stored elsewhere.</p>
	<p>To purchase an item for sale, write the order code shown, such as P1. Forges can repair damaged Iron and Silver weapons and armor. The cost is roughly 25% the price of an undamaged one. To have an item repaired, issue the REPAIR ITEM order: R (Item#). This takes 8 Action Points. (Note: The RID order does not function in a square having a Far Forge.)</p>
