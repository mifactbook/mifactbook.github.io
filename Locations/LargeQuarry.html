		From the front, the Large Quarry is little more than a heavy, wrought-iron gate blocking a path. Most of it is over a hill and securely out of site, If you have the will and power, you can try to crash the gate and see what lies inside.
		Of course, you may find yourself treading into areas that are unsafe, dangerous. or downright unpleasant. Heck, you might even get wet. To enter, issue the LV order. In this case it will cost you 40 Action Points.

	<h2>Inside a Large Quarry</h2>
	<p>
		Wow. This place is amazing. In the middle is a HUGE body of water surrounded by precipitous cliffs of solid stone This place is obviously not natural and must have taken some monster race years and years to make.
		There are enormous piles of quarried stone laying about in piles. From the size of the trees growing on some of these piles, this place looks to have been unused fr a very long time. From the looks of things, they must have left in a big hurry.
