<div class="info-section">
	<h2>Rebuilt Tower</h2>
	<p>Wow! This thing is tall, tall, tall. Well, it's not as tall as a <a href="../Locations/KongoMongoTree.html">Kongo Mongo Tree</a> but it'd still hurt to fall off the thing. Rebuilt Towers are the home of <a href="../Blurbs/Wizards.html">Wizards</a>. If the Tower you are seeing is inhabited, a Wizard will be along shortly to inform you of your status. If it is empty, you can always go through the motions of attracting one of your own, if you know how.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
	<h2>Attracting A Wizard to Your Tower</h2>
	<p>If you ever manage to complete the rebuilding of a Tower, you will find it to be a relatively large pile of stone with lots of room to sit. You can even take turns spitting off the parapet. Ho-hum. What you really need to do is to attract the Tower's original <a href="../Blurbs/Wizards.html">Wizard</a> who was banished at the end of the last Demigod War.</p>
	<p>So while you still have your six group members, someone must issue the CALL WIZARD Order (CW). Your group will set about using the <a href="../Blurbs/XanxuConstruct.html">Xanxu Construct</a> to spin around the Tower. Eventually, it will attract the wanted attention and, with a puff of smoke, will be magically transformed before your eyes. It will cost the monster who issues the order 85 Action Points.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
	<h2>Admit Groups to Your Tower</h2>
	<p>Being a Tower Master has its advantages and its responsibilities. Determining who gets to take advantage of the offerings is a big one. To approve a Group for admittance to your Tower, issue the ADMIT GROUP Order (AG &lt;Tower#&gt; &lt;Group#&gt;) where Tower# is the tower where you are Tower Master and Group# is the group you wish to grant admission to the Tower.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
	<h2>Admit Monsters to Your Tower</h2>
	<p>Okay, so you hate group X but like Monster Y. You want to keep out the riffraff but allow an individual to take part in the Wonderful World of <a href="../Blurbs/Wizards.html">Wizards</a>. Easy enough, just use the ADMIT MONSTER Order (AM &lt;Tower#&gt; &lt;Monster#&gt;) where Tower# is the number of the Tower where you are the Tower Master and Monster# is the number of the monster you wish to grant entrance to.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
	<h2>Buying From and Selling To Wizards</h2>
	<p>Yep, you can even buy and sell at a Tower. Purchasable items are listed in the Tower service list and can be bought using the TOWER PURCHASE Order (P#) where # refers to the item listing on the services board. To Sell to a Tower, you must issue the same old Sell order you use elsewhere (P#) where # is the item number. Of course, <a href="../Blurbs/Wizards.html">Wizards</a> don't buy everything. You can also collect bounties at Towers by issuing the COLLECT BOUNTY order (CB). Bounty items are also listed on the Tower Service List.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
	<h2>Dopplegangers</h2>
	<p>As if one version of a Ruk wasn't one version too many, <a href="../Blurbs/Wizards.html">Wizards</a> have the remarkable talent of creating nearly exact duplicates of any living creatures. Dopplegangers are exactly that - carbon copies, right down to armor and clothing. They even do chores like cleaning and can be convinced to take baths with the touch of a staff. All Ruks should be so compliant. For what it is worth, Dopplegangers can be used for defenses and can fight just like the real item.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
	<h2>Special Skill Training at a Tower</h2>
	<p>With <a href="../Blurbs/Wizards.html">Wizards</a> being an intelligent lot, you can learn special skills and knowledge at a Tower. To purchase such skill, issue the SPECIAL SKILL TRAINING ORDER (TK#) where # is the item you wish to learn about on the Tower's service list. It will cost you 80 Action Points to issue this order.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
	<h2>Spell Training at a Tower</h2>
	<p><a href="../Blurbs/Wizards.html">Wizards</a> know lots of things and are willing to trade this knowledge for a few <a href="../Blurbs/OcularCoin.html">oculars</a>. If you wish to learn <a href="../Items/AllSpellsByName.html">spells</a> from a Wizard then issue the TOWER MAGIC Order (TX #) where # is the number referred to on the list of services offered. It will cost you 80 Action Points to issue this order.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
	<h2>Staying at a Tower</h2>
	<p>Much like an <a href="../Locations/FarInn.html">Inn</a>, you can stay in a Tower 'tween turns and take advantage of the atmosphere and vapours for your betterment. To take up a room, issue the TOWER STAY order (TI &lt;Level&gt;) when you end your turn in the square with a Tower inhabited by a <a href="../Blurbs/Wizards.html">Wizard</a>. Tower Stay levels are 1 (lowest), 3 (midrange), 5 (upper midrange) and 7 (the best).</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
	<h2>Tower Master</h2>
	<p>Just what a Ruk needs, something to think about. Being a Tower Master is a big duty. You have to be the one to tell the <a href="../Blurbs/Wizards.html">Wizard</a> who gets to come in and who gets to take a hike. At first, you might think this is a stupid chore, but once you learn more, you'll find it to be quite the little enterprise.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
	<h2>Tower Teleport</h2>
	<p>The presence of the major dieties is scarce in the Zargnoth, thanks to the work of the four major demi-gods. As such getting around can be a major drag. what with all that walking, and walking, and walking. That is unless you find a <a href="../Locations/ZargnothRailway.html">train</a> and like being locked in a box for ages.</p>
	<p>The <a href="../Blurbs/ZoingoMutant.html">Zoingots</a>, being smarter than the average Ruk (but then, well, you know) had their <a href="../Blurbs/Wizards.html">Wizards</a> work on this and the result is Telportation between <a href="../Locations/Tower.html">Towers</a>. To go from one tower to another, just issue the order, TT &lt;Tower#&gt;, where Tower# is the Tower you wish to go to. It'll cost you 100 oculars and 100 Action Points.</p>
