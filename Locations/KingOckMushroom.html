		Giant fleshy fungi abound here. The brown and white King Ock Mushrooms are the largest mushrooms in existence. Some come up to your chin in height. The stalk is 2 to 3 hands in diameter, while the umbrella-like top is 4 to 6 hands. When a gust of wind blows by, it's eerie or perhaps amusing to watch them move - sort of like giant Jello Creatures. You attempt to pick one but discover that it starts to disintegrate on you - and you can't figure out how to carry something so large anyway. Of curious note is how there are no palm trees anywhere near the grove, despite the terrain being predominantly Sand &amp; Palms.
