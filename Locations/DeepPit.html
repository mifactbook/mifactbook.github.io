		Holes 13+ hands deep are pits. Falling into one can be very damaging. After finding or digging one, you can trap it by issuing the TRAP PIT order: TP. (Takes 2 Action Points.) This has you place something nasty in the pit (whatever is handy - a captured Creature, if appropriate).
		You'll then camouflage the opening and hope some Creature or Monster will blunder down into it. Unless you're a master at trapping a pit, any Monster that falls into your pit will be able to extricate himself from it, but often after a loss of Health.
		Note: You and members of your race or group (if you've joined a group) will not fall into your own pits. You'll recognize them for what they are and check it. Your race or group may only have one <a href="../Locations/HideyHole.html">Hidey-Hole</a>/Deep Pit per square.
