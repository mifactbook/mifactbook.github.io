	<p>This magnificent metal structure must have taken huge amounts of magic to put in place. A true wonder of the Island, it looks quite out of place, especially with the ramshackle train track currently running across it.</p>

	<h2>CROSSING THE BRIDGE</h2>

	<p>
		If you're feeling particularly brave or stupid, this would be a possible <a href="../Items/River.html">river</a> crossing. The only problem is that the bridge is not wide enough for both a train and a monster, and no surprises
		as to which would come off worse in a collision. If you think you're fast enough to avoid becoming Muncher Beast meat then issue the Cross Railway Bridge Order (XR). This takes 20 Action points. If successful you will end up in the same square,
		but on the other side of the river.
