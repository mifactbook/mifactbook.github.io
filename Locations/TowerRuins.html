		Before you is a large pile of large gray stones. The stones are strewn around a circular foundation roughly 30 hands in diameter. This place gives you the creeps. What would be the purpose of such a tower? When you find that out you may want to rebuild this tower. You can do so by issuing the REBUILD order: Z (Action Points). Each time you issue this order you'll be told the new state of repair. It will be challenging to rebuild the upper portion - you'll have to be very muscular!

	<h2>Rebuilding Tower Ruins</h2>
	<p>
		The Innkeeper tells you that such ruins were once a Wizard's Tower. Long ago, a Wizard would live in such a place so that he could conduct his experiments in a secure stone building. The Innkeeper thinks it's pointless to rebuild a Tower now - who could use it? There are no Wizards around. And, it'll take someone or something with extraordinary might to rebuild the upper portion.
