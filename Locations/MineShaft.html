		Solitary and alone, the dark and foreboding Mine Shaft lies on the side of a solitary hill. Its entrance is little more than a gaping hole in the side of the hill supported by huge timbers.
		In fact, the timbers are so huge that they could only have come from a <a href="../Locations/KongoMongoTree.html">Kongo Mongo Tree</a>, and everyone knows how tough Kongo Mongo Trees are to cut down.
		The power need to cut them must have been enormous. This looks like an inviting dark place if you have an excellent light source. Issue the U 33 order to explore.
		It will cost you 60 Action Points and the equivalent of three torches.

	<h2>Inside a Mine Shaft</h2>
	<p>
		Inside the Mine Shaft there is little more than solid rock walls and a dirt or mud floor. The shaft gives you the impression of being very old and very abandoned. On the floor, you see footprints of various creatures although they are too disturbed to recognize.
		In the far distance, you swear you can hear noises but they are very hard to make out. It's best to be prepared for anything in this place and to come with a good implement for <a href="../Items/Mining.html">mining</a>.
