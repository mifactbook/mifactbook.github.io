		Not your everyday, ordinary kind of <a href="../Blurbs/Coconut.html">coconut</a>. The Hairy Coconut grows only in a very restricted locale. To get them, you must climb very, very, very hight into the very, very, very tall Hairy Coco Palm. Since this is well beyond anything you'd do willingly you'll have to issue the CLIMB HAIRY COCO PALM order (HP) when you locate one. You'll collect as many as are ripe at the time. You can carry up to twelve Hairy Coconuts.
