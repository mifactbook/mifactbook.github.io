		Picture a very large slab of marble. It is cut at strange angles. You can make out the word FUVAH, as it is etched in large lettering in the very center. Covering the rest of the stone are scenes of battle. It is obvious that <a href="../Items/Fuvah.html">Fuvah</a> must have been a tremendous warrior - perhaps the greatest of all time - for his followers to have erected this shrine. A quick measure: It's about 12 hands high, 9 hands wide, and 6 hands deep. You guess that it's hundreds of years old.
