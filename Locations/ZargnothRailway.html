	<h1>Railway Stations</h1>
</header>

<div class="info-section">
	<p>A Railway Station in Zargnoth consists of three fairly rudimentary facilities:</p>

	<ol style="margin-left:25px;margin-bottom:15px;">
		<li>The Beast and Carriage Stable is where the Muncher Beasts are hosed down and groomed, the Red Kachoos rest, and the carriages are repaired.</li>
		<li>The private living quarters of the <a href="../Blurbs/ZoingoMutant.html">Zoingot</a> drivers.</li>
		<li>The public area which consists of a ticket office and passenger waiting area.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>The orders P1, P2, P3 and P4 will buy a journey to the listed town. If you purchase a season ticket using the P9 order then there is no charge for any subsequent P1 - P4 orders done during that turn and the following ten turns.</p>

<div class="info-section">
	<h2>Zargnoth Trains</h2>
	<p>The CARRIAGES are custom-built by <a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html">Jossmen</a> <a href="../Locations/FarForge.html">Forgers</a>, they're 60 hands long and functional rather than comfortable. RED KACHOOS push the railway carriages. There is usually a male-female pair plus their offspring, if any. They're loyal, simple creatures with great strength and endurance. The <a href="../Blurbs/ZoingoMutant.html">Zoingots</a> have brought them over as locomotion for their railway. Interestingly, they're magic resistant. Strapped to the front is a MUNCHER BEAST. It eats anything in its path. Picture a short, stubby, wide-mouthed snake enlarged to the size of a rhino. It is a docile, friendly creature, but only the Zoingots, who have imported them, seem to have the ability to domesticate them. The Muncher Beast also appears to be magic resistant.</p>

<div class="info-section">
	<h2>ZR - Zargnoth Railways</h2>
	<p>Stretching as far north and south as the eye can see is one of the island's greatest technical achievements, the Zargnoth Railway, a joint project between the <a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html">Jossmen</a> and the <a href="../Blurbs/ZoingoMutant.html">Zoingots</a>. Every 20 Action Points or so a train rattles by.</p>
	<p><strong>THE TRACK</strong><br>
	Probably the least spectacular part of the railway is the well worn and not very straight wooden track.</p>
	<p><strong>THE TRAINS</strong><br>
	You've never before seen such a weird combination of creatures and items, but it would seem to work. A pair of Red Kachoos push the <a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html">Jossman</a>-constructed carriage along, a <a href="../Blurbs/ZoingoMutant.html">Zoingo Mutant</a> sits up on top giving them directions, and a Muncher Beast is fastened to the front, eating anything in the train's path.</p>
