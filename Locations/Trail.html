		Throughout the island you will find paths that lead from one square to another. Paths intersect at the center of a square and it's possible, but unlikely, to have 8 paths leading out from a square.
		The travel of Monsters and Creatures causes a path to become more beaten down. TRAILS are well beaten paths and may indicate a major travel route. PATHS are lesser trails. To follow a TRAIL or PATH use
		the HUNT or TRAVEL order and precede your Direction(s) with a 9. Example: H 934. This is useful when moving into terrain you have not visited before and will have you head in the general direction
		specified on the most worn path or trail. If the trail or path disappears then you'll move in the direction specified.

	<h2>Following Trail / Path Notes</h2>
	<p>
		Here's a good example: If you write T 923 this means that you'll move one square either N, NE, or E (whichever has the most worn Trail/Path) - if there's no Trail/Path in these three directions you'll go NE...even if there's a Trail/Path heading in any of the other 5 directions.
		Next you'll move one square either NE, E, or SE. What's nice is that when you're following a Trail/Path it will usually keep to the same direction or veer to an adjacent direction, so that the Follow Trail/Path order will almost always keep you on the Trail/Path until it ends.
