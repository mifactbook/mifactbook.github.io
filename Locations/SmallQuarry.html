		A relict of the distant past, the Small Quarry is quite a curiosity. It was once guarded by a small iron fence that has now rusted solid.
		The fence has a slightly ominous feel to it though it's hard to tell what could be wrong with a place like this. What this place was used
		for and why it was abandoned are things that will be difficult to find out. If you wish to explore this dark place, issue the
		<a href="../Blurbs/LootNVandalize.html">Loot 'n Vandalize</a> order if you know it. It will cost you 16 Action Points.
