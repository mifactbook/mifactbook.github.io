		Just what a monster needs, an excuse to get in the water. Underwater Grottos are not really underwater, just their entrances. And they are inevitably guarded by a pack of <a href="../Blurbs/GiantRockadile.html">Giant Rockadiles</a>.
		If you have ever had the misfortune to run into these brutes during a bath, you will have had ample time to notice the eerie blue glow that issues from the mouth of this cave. Its caused by a harmless(?) fungus that lines the walls.
		Giant Rockadiles don't take kindly to visitors in their <a href="../Locations/Pond.html">Ponds</a>. So you better have a plan for dealing with them if you want to explore this dark place. Of course, you may have noticed that Monsters swim like rocks....BIG rocks.
		How you're going to overcome that obstacle will show what kind of brains you really have.
