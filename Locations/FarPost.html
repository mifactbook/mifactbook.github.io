<div class="info-section">
	<p>Nestled in and behind a large array of bushes is a very sturdy-looking bamboo hut. Strewn about the place are all sorts of things. Some items you recognize, others you don't. There are no weapons, nor anything exotic and/or of high value.</p>
	<p>You learn from the <a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html">Jossman</a> that runs this Far Post that anything you see is for sale. They will also buy Common Items and <a href="../Items/Voodoo.html">Voodoo</a> Ingredients. This means they do not buy Weapons, Armor and Special Items. Nor items of no resale value: <a href="../Blurbs/Coconut.html">Coconuts</a>, <a href="../Blurbs/SmallRoundRock.html">rocks</a>, <a href="../Blurbs/JuteRope.html">rope</a>, food, <a href="../Blurbs/Oil.html">oil</a> and <a href="../Blurbs/Lime.html">limes</a>.</p>
	<p>You receive a free appraisal of the items the post is willing to purchase. You can also try to buy items (at double the selling price). An entire family lives at this post. These Jossmen are clad in worn-looking tunics.</p>

	<h2>Far Post Trading</h2>
	<p>Far Posts are the places you can buy and sell Common Items and Voodoo Ingredients. To sell an item, write the SELL TO FAR POST order: P (Item#) (Qty). You'll usually be able to buy any Common Item or <a href="../Items/Voodoo.html">Voodoo</a> Ingredient that you have the blurb for. Write the BUY FROM FAR POST order: B (Item#) (Qty). Far Posts transact only in <a href="../Blurbs/OcularCoin.html">Ocular coins</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
	<h2>Trading With Jossmen</h2>
	<p><a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html">Jossmen</a> are very fair traders. At their Far Posts they always give you a fair price. At <a href="../Locations/FarInn.html">Far Inns</a>, they tell you how well they pay/charge for a category of items.</p>
	<p>When at a square having a Far Inn, you can ask the Innkeeper to appraise your Armor, Weapons, and Rare Items. This is done in privacy, inside the Trade Room. The Innkeeper is not likely to blab to anyone about what you have. The Innkeeper will tell you what price his (or her) Inn will pay, for a fee of 1 Ocular. Issue the APPRAISE order: AP. It takes 0 Action Points. The Innkeeper will not appraise items in the Exotic Weapons, Exotic Armor, or Special categories, nor items bought/sold at a Far Post.</p>
