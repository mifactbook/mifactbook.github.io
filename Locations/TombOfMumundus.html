		Out of place in this swampy, wet terrain is an imposing, very-weathered, rectangular, stone structure. Rising up nearly 45 hands, you spot many large, very realistic-looking statues - the kind you think could come to life at any moment.
		Your senses tell you that great danger is lurking near. You see no obvious entrance and guess that there's some sort of secret panel or switch that'll get you inside.  However, unless you're heavily armored and superiorly armed, entering
		this Tomb is going to be a most excellent way to learn about death.
