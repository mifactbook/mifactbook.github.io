	<h1>Far Inn</h1>
</header>

<div class="info-section">
	<p>This is the dwelling and business of a large family of <a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html">Jossmen</a>. Travelers are welcome to stay (for a fee) to have both a good meal and recover their health by resting in a fairly protected place. Those staying at the Inn may avail themselves to Weapon Instruction (if offered). Even if you decide not to stay, they'll always give you a drink of water and allow you to purchase and sell certain items and knowledge.</p>
	<p>Viewed from outside, the Inn is made of a stone foundation that supports many tied-together bamboo poles. The building's straw thatched roof is covered with a waterproofing resin. Most Far Inns are found in <a href="../Items/HighHills.html">High Hills</a> terrain. Far Inns are great places to meet other Monsters and learn to communicate with them.</p>
</div>

	<h2>Inside a Far Inn</h2>
	<p>Opening the door and stepping inside you see an entryway to the Great Room directly to your right. To the left a hallway leads to the guest rooms. Looking straight ahead a hall leads to a doorway marked "Private: Innkeeper's Quarters." You turn right and stride into the Great Room.</p>
	<p>At the far end is a bar. You discover that it is usually attended by the Innkeeper's assistant. Behind the left end of the bar is a door that leads into the kitchen. The rest of the room is filled with rattan tables and chairs. Adjacent to the kitchen is a very securely locked door marked Trade Room.</p>
	<p>Other notes: A stable exists in the back. Most doors have locks on them. The one-story structure in general is fairly well built. It also has a small basement and a storage loft.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
	<h2>Far Inn Services</h2>
	<p>You may stay at a Far Inn 'TWEEN turns by issuing one of the INN STAY orders. You must end your turn's movement at the square where the Inn lies. Staying longer than the end of the following week may cause the Inn to raise prices.</p>
	<p>Only if you stay at the Inn may you issue the INN WEAPON TRAINING order. You can choose only one (if more than one choice is offered) and you must have both a weapon of the type of the Weapon Class and already be at least at Skill Level 1 with it. The Inn's Weapon Instructor conducts the training 'TWEEN turns and the result will be an increase of 1 Skill Level.</p>
	<p>You pay for both INN STAY and INN WEAPON TRAINING during MAKE CAMP. Far Inns reserve the right to deny these services to anyone.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
	<h2>Bounty</h2>
	<p>Several races (but not the Seven Monster Races) take perverse pleasure in ambushing <a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html">Jossmen</a> whenever they can. Because Western Dragoon Patrols can't be everywhere, Far Inns have established a standing Bounty.</p>
	<p>Each Far Inn pays a certain amount for a particular item, such as <a href="../Blurbs/JaggedBodkin.html">Jagged Bodkins</a> and <a href="../Blurbs/TomkNecklace.html">Tomk Necklaces</a>. Issue the COLLECT BOUNTY order: CB, when at a Far Inn to cash in all Bounty items (except equipped items).</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
	<h2>Riding Lessons at a Far Inn</h2>
	<p>Your first look at the inside of the stables (located in the back of the Far Inn) is when you first arrive at a Far Inn riding a <a href="../Blurbs/Mounts.html">Mount</a>. Usually, one of the <a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html">Jossmen</a> at the Far Inn offers to teach, for a fee of 11 <a href="../Blurbs/Ocular.html">oculars</a>, new riders how to handle, ride, and groom a Mount. Issue the order: X6.</p>
	<p>Additional riding lessons (at 7 oculars each) are available to novice riders. Again, issue the order: X6. Although Jossmen seem to be adept at riding a Mount, most Far Inns lack a very experienced rider. This is why you'd only want to take about 5 or so additional lessons. Each lesson takes 30 Action Points.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
	<h2>Far Inn Trading</h2>
	<p>Jossmen conduct transactions with Ocular coins only. You can sell non-exotic Weapons, Armor and Rare Items to an Inn by issuing the SELL TO INN order: P (Item#) (Qty).</p>
	<p>If you've the Oculars you can do any or all of the following: Buy items by issuing the PURCHASE FROM INN order. If there's special knowledge for sale, issue the INN KNOWLEDGE order. To acquire instruction offered by a Voodoo Master, issue the INN VOODOO INSTRUCTION order.</p>
	<p>You need to be at the square the Inn lies at to do any of these. Except for the sell order, you need to issue a letter+number code that appears to the left of what you want. Examples: I7 to stay/work at an Inn or V1 to get instruction in something about Voodoo.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
	<h2>Working at an Inn</h2>
	<p>Most <a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html">Innkeepers</a> have a soft spot in their Monster hearts for other Monsters who are down on their luck. Class 7 accommodations usually include either a cot or a soft pile of hay placed in the poorest of rooms. Even these meagre accommodations offer considerable relief after a hard day working for the Innkeeper.</p>
	<p>He'll usually save the dirtiest and most foul jobs for the Class 7 guests to perform. Common tasks include digging a cesspool, cleaning the stables, and carrying barrels up from the cellar. The owner lets you graze through the leftovers of the paying guests to fill your stomach. What's particularly nice is that the Innkeeper also pays you a few <a href="../Blurbs/Ocular.html">Oculars</a> for your hard work.</p>
