		This is a large, white stone, roughly 20 hands high, 8 wide, and 8 deep. At eye level is a prism embedded in the stone. You stare at the stone for quite some time. Suddenly the sun comes out from under a cloud and shines directly into the prism. Expecting to see a rainbow of sorts, you are suprised to see writing. It says "<a href="../Items/Kabuki.html">The Great Kabuki, God of Light</a>, welcomes your prayers and loyalty. Kowtow to me Here." To do this, issue the KOWTOW order: K (Action Points).
