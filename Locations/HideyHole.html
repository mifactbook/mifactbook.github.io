		Holes that are 8 to 12 hands deep are very useful to hide in. Simply end your movement in such a hole and you will be hiding. Because of this, no one can XFER anything to you. To hide in a Hidey-hole, write the ENTER HOLE order: EH.
		To exit a hole, simply issue any movement order. This order is only useful if you do it after your last movement order for the turn. Your race or group may only have one Hidey-Hole/<a href="../Locations/DeepPit.html">Deep Pit</a> per square.
		Only one Monster per hole, and don't try taking your Mount down there (if you have one)!
