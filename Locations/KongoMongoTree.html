		Standing before you is the largest pillar of wood and bark on the Island. The trunk is as broad as a modest patch of forest. The bark has giant furrows that make excellent routes for climbing. If you've sufficient muscle, upon reaching one of these trees, you'll automatically climb it.
		As you look up, you see the thinner topmost branches are shrouded in clouds. If you get there, you'll have a great view - no branches or trees to obstruct your vision. This enables you to see the larger structures (such as <a href="../Locations/FarForge.html">Far Forges</a>
		and <a href="../Locations/AncientGraveyard.html">Ancient Graveyards</a>) in the eight adjacent squares. If you've a <a href="../Blurbs/SpyGlass.html">Spyglass</a>, you'll be able to spot some of the smaller structures too, such as <a href="../Locations/SmallCave.html">Small Caves</a>.
		Of course, if you should slip, its a veeeerrrrrryyyyy long fall to the ground.
