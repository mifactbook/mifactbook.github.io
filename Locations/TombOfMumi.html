		A strange structure is embedded in the hillside before you. Ornate stonework stands over 30 hands tall. Ugly carvings of creatures you've never seen before line the steps leading to the entrance. At least you think it is an entrance.
		There is a large, rounded stone pushed in front of where the door should be. Above the stone is the inscription TOMB OF MUMI - TRESPASSERS WILL BE DISEMBOWLED. You walk closer and examine the stone blocking the entrance.
		A portion is covered with dried blood in thich somew threads of grey cloth have become embedded. After a wile you examine more carvings. They show burial ceremonies among scenes of battle. You need Muscle of 40+ to move the stone aside and a <a href="../Blurbs/Torch.html">Torch</a>
		is needed to explore it: U 33. It will take 14 Action Points.

	<h2>Inside Tomb of Mumi</h2>

	<p>
		Past the entryway you find three main chambers - each crypt filled with over a dozen coffins. Dust and spiderwebs and bones(!) are everywhere. The poor lighting makes the shadows look very ominous. The smell of death lurks everywhere.
		The centre chamber is the most impressive - it is obvious that the more important bodies were entombed here. Examining the coffins, some you find to be decrepit, others seem almost new or in excellent condition (and that's a tad frightening).
		This is not a place where you want to spend a second more than you have to. Candelabrums are built into the walls at strategic spots. Every so often you think you hear bones shifting in place, just a bit. Or else your mind is playing tricks on you.
