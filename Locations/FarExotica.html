<div class="info-section">
	<p>One of the more resplendent of <a href="../Blurbs/Jossman.html">Jossman</a> buildings is the Far Exotica. Made from top quality bamboo and stone with a thatched roof, its owner has obviously ploughed some of his profits into its reconstruction. It is a cross between department store and a bureau de change.</p>
	<p>Certain Towns are known to specialise in making certain exotic consumer goods, and so the wise buyer can make a profit transporting them to where they're in demand.</p>
	<p>The Exotica's other main line is currency exchange. Should you be reaching your carrying limit for <a href="../Blurbs/Ocular.html">Oculars</a>, they will exchange them for <a href="../Blurbs/GoldenOcularCoin.html">Golden Ocular coins</a>. There is no charge for this and only a small charge to change Oculars with any of the other more exotic coins. But, before you ask, they don't deal in <a href="../Blurbs/BitCoin.html">Bit Coins</a>!</p>
